Starting at http://www.scriptureearth.org/data/ you can descend into subfolders
for the different languages. Oftentimes there is a SQLite3 database file, which
makes the bibles easily accessible. These files have the file ending '.mybible'.
Only for these files exist a converter script into the PAR format.
