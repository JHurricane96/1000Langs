The crawling script needs as starting point the URL to the first chapter
of the bible to be crawled because it simply follows the link to the
following chapter to crawl the whole bible.

The parsing script expects the normal parameters `starting directory`,
`books2numbers file` and additionally the ISO 639-3 code for the header.
