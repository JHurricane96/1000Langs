      "The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan.\n",
      "These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole earth was populated.\n",
      "Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.\n",
      "He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent.\n",
      "Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.\n",

      "All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, and then he died.\n",
      "Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.\n",
      "The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.\n",
      "The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.\n",
      "The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\n",

      "The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.\n",
      "The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan.\n",
      "Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.\n",
      "He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh”.\n",
      "The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\n",
      "Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,\n",
      "and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah.\n",
      "Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,\n",

      "the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,\n",
      "the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.\n",
      "The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go toward Gerar—to Gaza—as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha.\n",
      "These are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.\n",
      "Children were also born to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth.\n",
      "The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.\n",
      "The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.\n",
      "Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.\n",

      "Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.\n",
      "These are the sons of Shem, by their families, according to their languages, lands, and nations.\n",
      "These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood.\n",
      "The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.\n",
      "As they traveled east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.\n",
      "They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.\n",
      "They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.”\n",
      "Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.\n",
      "Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.\n",
      "Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”\n",
      "So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.\n",
      "Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.\n",
      "This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.\n",
      "Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters.\n",
      "Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.\n",

      "Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters.\n",
      "Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.\n",
      "Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.\n",
      "Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\n",
      "Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot.\n",
      "Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.\n",
      "Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah.\n",
      "Sarai was barren. She had no child.\n",
      "Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.\n",
      "The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.\n",
      "Now Yahweh said to Abram, “Leave your country, and your relatives, and your father’s house, and go to the land that I will show you.\n",
      "I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.\n",
      "I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.”\n",
      "So Abram went, as Yahweh had told him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.\n",
      "Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother’s son, all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan. They entered into the land of Canaan.\n",
      "Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanites were in the land, then.\n",
      "Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.” He built an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared to him.\n",
      "He left from there to go to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on Yahweh’s name.\n",
      "Abram traveled, still going on toward the South.\n",
      "There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land.\n",
      "When he had come near to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.\n",
      "It will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me, but they will save you alive.\n",
      "Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.”\n",
      "When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.\n",
      "The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.\n",
      "He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.\n",
      "Yahweh afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.\n",
      "Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife?\n",
      "Why did you say, ‘She is my sister, ’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.”\n",
      "Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they escorted him away with his wife and all that he had.\n",
      "Abram went up out of Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into the South.\n",
      "Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.\n",
      "He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,\n",
      "to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on Yahweh’s name.\n",
      "Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents.\n",
      "The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.\n",
      "There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.\n",
      "Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives.\n",
      "Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”\n",
      "Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.\n",
      "So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.\n",
      "Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.\n",
      "Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,\n",
      "for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.\n",
      "I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be numbered.\n",
      "Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its breadth; for I will give it to you.”\n",
      "Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.\n",
      "In the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim,\n",
      "they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar).\n",
      "All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea).\n",
      "They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.\n",
      "In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,\n",
      "and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.\n",
      "They returned, and came to En Mishpat (also called Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar.\n",
      "The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim;\n",
      "against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.\n",
      "Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and some fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills.\n",
      "They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.\n",
      "They took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.\n",
      "One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. At that time, he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and they were allies of Abram.\n",
      "When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.\n",
      "He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.\n",
      "He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the other people.\n",
      "The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).\n",
      "Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.\n",
      "He blessed him, and said, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:\n",
      "and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” Abram gave him a tenth of all.\n",
      "The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself.”\n",
      "Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,\n",
      "that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’\n",
      "I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.”\n",
      "After these things Yahweh’s word came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”\n",
      "Abram said, “Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”\n",
      "Abram said, “Behold, to me you have given no children: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.”\n",
      "Behold, Yahweh’s word came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir.”\n",
      "Yahweh brought him outside, and said, “Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” He said to Abram, “So will your offspring be.”\n",
      "He believed in Yahweh, who reckoned it to him for righteousness.\n",
      "He said to Abram, “I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.”\n",
      "He said, “Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?”\n",
      "He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”\n",
      "He brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds.\n",
      "The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.\n",
      "When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him.\n",
      "He said to Abram, “Know for sure that your offspring will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.\n",
      "I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth,\n",
      "but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age.\n",
      "In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.”\n",
      "It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.\n",
      "In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, “I have given this land to your offspring, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:\n",
      "the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,\n",
      "the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,\n",
      "the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”\n",
      "Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.\n",
      "Sarai said to Abram, “See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my handmaid. It may be that I will obtain children by her.” Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.\n",
      "Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.\n",
      "He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n",
      "Sarai said to Abram, “This wrong is your fault. I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. Yahweh judge between me and you.”\n",
      "But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good in your eyes.” Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to Shur.\n",
      "He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid, where did you come from? Where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.”\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.”\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel said to her, “I will greatly multiply your offspring, that they will not be numbered for multitude.”\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel said to her, “Behold, you are with child, and will bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your affliction.\n",
      "He will be like a wild donkey among men. His hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him. He will live opposite all of his brothers.”\n",
      "She called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees, ” for she said, “Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?”\n",
      "Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.\n",

      "Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.\n",
      "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram, and said to him, “I am God Almighty. Walk before me, and be blameless.\n",
      "I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.”\n",
      "Abram fell on his face. God talked with him, saying,\n",
      "“As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations.\n",
      "Your name will no more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.\n",
      "I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you.\n",
      "I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your offspring after you.\n",
      "I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God.”\n",
      "God said to Abraham, “As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.\n",

      "You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you.\n",
      "He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.\n",
      "He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.\n",
      "The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant.”\n",
      "God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name will be Sarah.\n",

      "Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.\n",
      "I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.” They said, “Very well, do as you have said.”\n",
      "Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly prepare three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.”\n",
      "Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it.\n",
      "He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate.\n",
      "They asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?” He said, “See, in the tent.”\n",
      "He said, “I will certainly return to you when the season comes round. Behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.” Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.\n",
      "Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.\n",
      "Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?’\n",
      "Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son.”\n",
      "Then Sarah denied it, saying, “I didn’t laugh, ” for she was afraid. He said, “No, but you did laugh.”\n",
      "The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.\n",
      "Yahweh said, “Will I hide from Abraham what I do,\n",
      "since Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?\n",
      "For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.”\n",
      "Yahweh said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,\n",
      "I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know.”\n",
      "The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.\n",
      "Abraham drew near, and said, “Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?\n",
      "What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?\n",
      "Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn’t the Judge of all the earth do right?”\n",
      "Yahweh said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.”\n",
      "Abraham answered, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, although I am dust and ashes.\n",
      "What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?” He said, “I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there.”\n",
      "He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?” He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.”\n",
      "He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?” He said, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.”\n",
      "He said, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there?” He said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.”\n",
      "He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?” He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.”\n",
      "Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.\n",
      "The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,\n",
      "and he said, “See now, my lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.” They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”\n",
      "He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.\n",
      "But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.\n",
      "They called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.”\n",
      "Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.\n",
      "He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly.\n",
      "See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.”\n",
      "They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near to break the door.\n",
      "But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.\n",
      "They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\n",
      "The men said to Lot, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:\n",
      "for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.”\n",
      "Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city.” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.\n",
      "When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.”\n",
      "But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.\n",
      "It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!”\n",
      "Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord.\n",
      "See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.\n",
      "See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.”\n",
      "He said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.\n",
      "Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n",
      "The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.\n",
      "Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.\n",
      "He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.\n",
      "But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\n",
      "Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.\n",
      "He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n",
      "When God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.\n",
      "Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.\n",
      "The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.\n",
      "Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”\n",
      "They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”\n",
      "They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up.\n",
      "Thus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father.\n",
      "The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.\n",
      "The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.\n",
      "Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.\n",
      "Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n",
      "But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man’s wife.”\n",
      "Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?\n",
      "Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister?’ She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this.”\n",
      "God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her.\n",
      "Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.”\n",
      "Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.\n",
      "Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!”\n",
      "Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”\n",
      "Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’\n",
      "Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\n",
      "When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”\n",
      "Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.\n",
      "Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.”\n",
      "To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.”\n",
      "Abraham prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children.\n",
      "For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.\n",
      "Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken.\n",
      "Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.\n",
      "Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.\n",
      "Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.\n",
      "Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him.\n",
      "Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.”\n",
      "She said, “Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.”\n",
      "The child grew, and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.\n",
      "Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.\n",
      "Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this handmaid and her son! For the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son, Isaac.”\n",
      "The thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son.\n",
      "God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac.\n",
      "I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid, because he is your child.”\n",
      "Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.\n",
      "The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.\n",
      "She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.” She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.\n",
      "God heard the voice of the boy. The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, “What ails you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.\n",
      "Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation.”\n",
      "God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink.\n",
      "God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.\n",
      "He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "At that time, Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do.\n",
      "Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.”\n",
      "Abraham said, “I will swear.”\n",
      "Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.\n",
      "Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t hear of it until today.”\n",
      "Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.\n",
      "Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n",
      "Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?”\n",
      "He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.”\n",
      "Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore there.\n",
      "So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.\n",
      "Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.\n",
      "Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.\n",
      "After these things, God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” He said, “Here I am.”\n",
      "He said, “Now take your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.”\n",
      "Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.\n",
      "On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.\n",
      "Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go yonder. We will worship, and come back to you.”\n",
      "Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together.\n",
      "Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”\n",
      "Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they both went together.\n",
      "They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.\n",
      "Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel called to him out of the sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” He said, “Here I am.”\n",
      "He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”\n",
      "Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.\n",
      "Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide. As it is said to this day, “On Yahweh’s mountain, it will be provided.”\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel called to Abraham a second time out of the sky,\n",
      "and said, “I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son,\n",
      "that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your offspring greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the gate of his enemies.\n",
      "All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring, because you have obeyed my voice.”\n",
      "So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.\n",
      "After these things, it was told Abraham, saying, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor:\n",
      "Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,\n",
      "Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”\n",
      "Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.\n",
      "His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.\n",
      "Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah’s life.\n",
      "Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\n",
      "Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,\n",
      "“I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”\n",
      "The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,\n",
      "“Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.”\n",
      "Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.\n",
      "He talked with them, saying, “If you agree that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,\n",
      "that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying-place.”\n",
      "Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,\n",
      "“No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.”\n",
      "Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.\n",
      "He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.”\n",
      "Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,\n",
      "“My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.”\n",
      "Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard.\n",
      "So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded\n",
      "to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.\n",
      "After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth.\n",
      "Abraham was old, and well stricken in age. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.\n",
      "Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh.\n",
      "I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.\n",
      "But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”\n",
      "The servant said to him, “What if the woman isn’t willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?”\n",
      "Abraham said to him, “Beware that you don’t bring my son there again.\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give this land to your offspring. He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.\n",
      "If the woman isn’t willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath to me. Only you shall not bring my son there again.”\n",
      "The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.\n",
      "The servant took ten camels, of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.\n",
      "He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.\n",
      "He said, “Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.\n",
      "Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.\n",
      "Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink, ’ and she will say, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink, ’—let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”\n",
      "Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.\n",
      "The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up.\n",
      "The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.”\n",
      "She said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.\n",
      "When she had done giving him drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking.”\n",
      "She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.\n",
      "The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not.\n",
      "As the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,\n",
      "and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge in?”\n",
      "She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”\n",
      "She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in.”\n",
      "The man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh.\n",
      "He said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.”\n",
      "The young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words.\n",
      "Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.\n",
      "When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me, ” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.\n",
      "He said, “Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.”\n",
      "The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.\n",
      "Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.” He said, “Speak on.”\n",
      "He said, “I am Abraham’s servant.\n",
      "Yahweh has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.\n",
      "Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him.\n",
      "My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,\n",
      "but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’\n",
      "I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’\n",
      "He said to me, ‘Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of my father’s house.\n",
      "Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’\n",
      "I came this day to the spring, and said, ‘Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go—\n",
      "behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink, ”\n",
      "and she will tell me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels, ”—let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master’s son.’\n",
      "Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’\n",
      "She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.\n",
      "I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.\n",
      "I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.\n",
      "Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.”\n",
      "Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can’t speak to you bad or good.\n",
      "Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as Yahweh has spoken.”\n",
      "When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh.\n",
      "The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother.\n",
      "They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”\n",
      "Her brother and her mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go.”\n",
      "He said to them, “Don’t hinder me, since Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.”\n",
      "They said, “We will call the young lady, and ask her.”\n",
      "They called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.”\n",
      "They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham’s servant, and his men.\n",
      "They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them.”\n",
      "Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way.\n",
      "Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South.\n",
      "Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.\n",
      "Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel.\n",
      "She said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” She took her veil, and covered herself.\n",
      "The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.\n",
      "Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved her. Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.\n",
      "Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.\n",
      "She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.\n",
      "Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.\n",
      "The sons of Midian were: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.\n",
      "Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,\n",
      "but to the sons of Abraham’s concubines, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.\n",
      "These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.\n",
      "Abraham gave up his spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.\n",
      "Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,\n",
      "the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.\n",
      "After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.\n",
      "Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore to Abraham.\n",
      "These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,\n",
      "Mishma, Dumah, Massa,\n",
      "Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.\n",
      "These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.\n",
      "These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.\n",
      "They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.\n",
      "This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.\n",
      "Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.\n",
      "Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.\n",
      "The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is so, why do I live?” She went to inquire of Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh said to her, “Two nations are in your womb. Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger.”\n",
      "When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.\n",
      "The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.\n",
      "After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.\n",
      "The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.\n",
      "Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.\n",
      "Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.\n",
      "Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom.\n",
      "Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”\n",
      "Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”\n",
      "Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.\n",
      "Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.\n",
      "There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.\n",
      "Yahweh appeared to him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.\n",
      "Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.\n",
      "I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring. In your offspring will all the nations of the earth be blessed,\n",
      "because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”\n",
      "Isaac lived in Gerar.\n",
      "The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister, ” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.”\n",
      "When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.\n",
      "Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’” Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”\n",
      "Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”\n",
      "Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”\n",
      "Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. Yahweh blessed him.\n",
      "The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.\n",
      "He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.\n",
      "Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.\n",
      "Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go from us, for you are much mightier than we.”\n",
      "Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.\n",
      "Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them.\n",
      "Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.\n",
      "The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.\n",
      "They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah.\n",
      "He left that place, and dug another well. They didn’t argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, “For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.”\n",
      "He went up from there to Beersheba.\n",
      "Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham’s sake.”\n",
      "He built an altar there, and called on Yahweh’s name, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac’s servants dug a well.\n",
      "Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.\n",
      "Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?”\n",
      "They said, “We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,\n",
      "that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of Yahweh.”\n",
      "He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.\n",
      "They rose up some time in the morning, and swore to one another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.\n",
      "The same day, Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”\n",
      "He called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.\n",
      "When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.\n",
      "They grieved Isaac’s and Rebekah’s spirits.\n",
      "When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, “My son?” He said to him, “Here I am.”\n",
      "He said, “See now, I am old. I don’t know the day of my death.\n",
      "Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison.\n",
      "Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.”\n",
      "Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n",
      "Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,\n",
      "‘Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.’\n",
      "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.\n",
      "Go now to the flock, and get me from there two good young goats. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves.\n",
      "You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”\n",
      "Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.\n",
      "What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.”\n",
      "His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.”\n",
      "He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved.\n",
      "Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.\n",
      "She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.\n",
      "She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n",
      "He came to his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”\n",
      "Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.”\n",
      "Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He said, “Because Yahweh your God gave me success.”\n",
      "Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.”\n",
      "Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”\n",
      "He didn’t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau’s hands. So he blessed him.\n",
      "He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He said, “I am.”\n",
      "He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you.” He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.\n",
      "His father Isaac said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.”\n",
      "He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.\n",
      "God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.\n",
      "Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers. Let your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you. Blessed be everyone who blesses you.”\n",
      "As soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\n",
      "He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.”\n",
      "Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” He said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”\n",
      "Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.”\n",
      "When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my father.”\n",
      "He said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.”\n",
      "He said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?”\n",
      "Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained him. What then will I do for you, my son?”\n",
      "Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.” Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "Isaac his father answered him, “Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above.\n",
      "By your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother. It will happen, when you will break loose, that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck.”\n",
      "Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.”\n",
      "The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.\n",
      "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran.\n",
      "Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away;\n",
      "until your brother’s anger turn away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”\n",
      "Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?”\n",
      "Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.\n",
      "Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.\n",
      "May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,\n",
      "and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your offspring with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.”\n",
      "Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah’s brother, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.\n",
      "Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan, ”\n",
      "and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram.\n",
      "Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father.\n",
      "Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.\n",
      "Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\n",
      "He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.\n",
      "He dreamed. Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.\n",
      "Behold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, “I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your offspring.\n",
      "Your offspring will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your offspring will all the families of the earth be blessed.\n",
      "Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to you.”\n",
      "Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, “Surely Yahweh is in this place, and I didn’t know it.”\n",
      "He was afraid, and said, “How dreadful is this place! This is none other than God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.”\n",
      "Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top.\n",
      "He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.\n",
      "Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,\n",
      "so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, and Yahweh will be my God,\n",
      "then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God’s house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you.”\n",
      "Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.\n",
      "He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well’s mouth was large.\n",
      "There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well’s mouth in its place.\n",
      "Jacob said to them, “My relatives, where are you from?” They said, “We are from Haran.”\n",
      "He said to them, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.”\n",
      "He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.”\n",
      "He said, “Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.”\n",
      "They said, “We can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we water the sheep.”\n",
      "While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them.\n",
      "When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.\n",
      "Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father.\n",
      "When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.\n",
      "Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” He lived with him for a month.\n",
      "Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?”\n",
      "Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n",
      "Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.\n",
      "Jacob loved Rachel. He said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.”\n",
      "Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.”\n",
      "Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.\n",
      "Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.”\n",
      "Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.\n",
      "In the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her.\n",
      "Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.\n",
      "In the morning, behold, it was Leah. He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”\n",
      "Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.\n",
      "Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years.”\n",
      "Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.\n",
      "Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her handmaid.\n",
      "He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\n",
      "Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.\n",
      "Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, “Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction. For now my husband will love me.”\n",
      "She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, “Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.” She named him Simeon.\n",
      "She conceived again, and bore a son. Said, “Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi.\n",
      "She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “This time will I praise Yahweh.” Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.\n",
      "When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I will die.”\n",
      "Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in God’s place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”\n",
      "She said, “Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.”\n",
      "She gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife, and Jacob went in to her.\n",
      "Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.\n",
      "Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son.” Therefore called she his name Dan.\n",
      "Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.\n",
      "Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed.” She named him Naphtali.\n",
      "When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.\n",
      "Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid, bore Jacob a son.\n",
      "Leah said, “How fortunate!” She named him Gad.\n",
      "Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid, bore Jacob a second son.\n",
      "Leah said, “Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.” She named him Asher.\n",
      "Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”\n",
      "She said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes, also?” Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”\n",
      "Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” He lay with her that night.\n",
      "God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.\n",
      "Leah said, “God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband.” She named him Issachar.\n",
      "Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.\n",
      "Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons.” She named him Zebulun.\n",
      "Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.\n",
      "God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.\n",
      "She conceived, bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.”\n",
      "She named him Joseph, saying, “May Yahweh add another son to me.”\n",
      "When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.\n",
      "Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.”\n",
      "Laban said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.”\n",
      "He said, “Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.”\n",
      "He said to him, “You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.\n",
      "For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?”\n",
      "He said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.\n",
      "I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire.\n",
      "So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be counted stolen.”\n",
      "Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.”\n",
      "That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\n",
      "He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.\n",
      "Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.\n",
      "He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.\n",
      "The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted.\n",
      "Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn’t put them into Laban’s flock.\n",
      "Whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in front of the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;\n",
      "but when the flock were feeble, he didn’t put them in. So the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.\n",
      "The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.\n",
      "He heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s. From that which was our father’s, has he gotten all this wealth.”\n",
      "Jacob saw the expression on Laban’s face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”\n",
      "Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,\n",
      "and said to them, “I see the expression on your father’s face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.\n",
      "You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.\n",
      "Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t allow him to hurt me.\n",
      "If he said this, ‘The speckled will be your wages, ’ then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this, ‘The streaked will be your wages, ’ then all the flock bore streaked.\n",
      "Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me.\n",
      "During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.\n",
      "The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob, ’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’\n",
      "He said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.\n",
      "I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”\n",
      "Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?\n",
      "Aren’t we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.\n",
      "For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.”\n",
      "Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,\n",
      "and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.\n",
      "Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.\n",
      "Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away.\n",
      "So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.\n",
      "Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.\n",
      "He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.\n",
      "God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.”\n",
      "Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.\n",
      "Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?\n",
      "Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;\n",
      "and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.\n",
      "It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.’\n",
      "Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my gods?”\n",
      "Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.’\n",
      "Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them.\n",
      "Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn’t find them. He went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.\n",
      "Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but didn’t find them.\n",
      "She said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up before you; for I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the teraphim.\n",
      "Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?\n",
      "Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.\n",
      "“These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks.\n",
      "That which was torn of animals, I didn’t bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.\n",
      "This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.\n",
      "These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.\n",
      "Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”\n",
      "Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?\n",
      "Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you.”\n",
      "Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n",
      "Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.\n",
      "Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.\n",
      "Laban said, “This heap is witness between me and you this day.” Therefore it was named Galeed\n",
      "and Mizpah, for he said, “Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.\n",
      "If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.”\n",
      "Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.\n",
      "May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.\n",
      "The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac.\n",
      "Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.\n",
      "Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.\n",
      "Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n",
      "When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place Mahanaim.\n",
      "Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.\n",
      "He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.\n",
      "I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.’”\n",
      "The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.”\n",
      "Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;\n",
      "and he said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.”\n",
      "Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good, ’\n",
      "I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.\n",
      "Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children.\n",
      "You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can’t be numbered because there are so many.’”\n",
      "He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother:\n",
      "two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,\n",
      "thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.\n",
      "He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.”\n",
      "He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’\n",
      "Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’”\n",
      "He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.\n",
      "You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”\n",
      "So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.\n",
      "He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.\n",
      "He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.\n",
      "Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.\n",
      "When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled.\n",
      "The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.” Jacob said, “I won’t let you go, unless you bless me.”\n",
      "He said to him, “What is your name?” He said, “Jacob”.\n",
      "He said, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.”\n",
      "Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.” He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” He blessed him there.\n",
      "Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”\n",
      "The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.\n",
      "Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.\n",
      "Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids.\n",
      "He put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.\n",
      "He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.\n",
      "Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.\n",
      "He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?” He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”\n",
      "Then the handmaids came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.\n",
      "Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n",
      "Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?” Jacob said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.”\n",
      "Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.”\n",
      "Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.\n",
      "Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it.\n",
      "Esau said, “Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.”\n",
      "Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.\n",
      "Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.”\n",
      "Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me.” He said, “Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”\n",
      "So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.\n",
      "Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.\n",
      "Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city.\n",
      "He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money.\n",
      "He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.\n",
      "Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.\n",
      "Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.\n",
      "His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.\n",
      "Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.”\n",
      "Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came.\n",
      "Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.\n",
      "The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; a thing ought not to be done.\n",
      "Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.\n",
      "Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.\n",
      "You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.”\n",
      "Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give.\n",
      "Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife.”\n",
      "The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,\n",
      "and said to them, “We can’t do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.\n",
      "Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;\n",
      "then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.\n",
      "But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our sister, and we will be gone.”\n",
      "Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son.\n",
      "The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father.\n",
      "Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,\n",
      "“These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.\n",
      "Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.\n",
      "Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.”\n",
      "All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.\n",
      "On the third day, when they were sore, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males.\n",
      "They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.\n",
      "Jacob’s sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.\n",
      "They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,\n",
      "and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house.\n",
      "Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.”\n",
      "They said, “Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?”\n",
      "God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.”\n",
      "Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments.\n",
      "Let us arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.”\n",
      "They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.\n",
      "They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn’t pursue the sons of Jacob.\n",
      "So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.\n",
      "He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.\n",
      "Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth.\n",
      "God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him.\n",
      "God said to him, “Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel.” He named him Israel.\n",
      "God said to him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body.\n",
      "The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your offspring after you will I give the land.”\n",
      "God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.\n",

      "The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.\n",
      "At that time, Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\n",
      "Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her, and went in to her.\n",
      "She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er.\n",
      "She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan.\n",
      "She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.\n",
      "Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.\n",
      "Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Yahweh. Yahweh killed him.\n",
      "Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring forl your brother.”\n",
      "Onan knew that the offspring wouldn’t be his; and when he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother.\n",
      "The thing which he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and he killed him also.\n",
      "Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up”; for he said, “Lest he also die, like his brothers.” Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.\n",
      "After many days, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.\n",
      "It was told Tamar, saying, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”\n",
      "She took off of her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn’t given to him as a wife.\n",
      "When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.\n",
      "He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to you, ” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”\n",
      "He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”\n",
      "He said, “What pledge will I give you?” She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.\n",
      "She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.\n",
      "Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her.\n",
      "Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?” They said, “There has been no prostitute here.”\n",
      "He returned to Judah, and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.’”\n",
      "Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven’t found her.”\n",
      "About three months later, Judah was told, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute. Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.” Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burnt.”\n",
      "When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man, whose these are, I am with child.” She also said, “Please discern whose are these—the signet, and the cords, and the staff.”\n",
      "Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.” He knew her again no more.\n",
      "In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb.\n",
      "When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This came out first.”\n",
      "As he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “Why have you made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called Perez.\n",
      "Afterward his brother came out, that had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.\n",
      "Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.\n",
      "Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.\n",
      "His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand.\n",
      "Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.\n",
      "From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake. Yahweh’s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.\n",
      "He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate. Joseph was well-built and handsome.\n",
      "After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.”\n",
      "But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.\n",
      "No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”\n",
      "As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn’t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\n",
      "About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.\n",
      "She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.\n",
      "When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,\n",
      "she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.\n",
      "When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”\n",
      "She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.\n",
      "She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,\n",
      "and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”\n",
      "When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your servant did to me, ” his wrath was kindled.\n",
      "Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.\n",
      "But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n",
      "The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.\n",
      "The keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.\n",
      "After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt.\n",
      "Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker.\n",
      "He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n",
      "The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days.\n",
      "They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.\n",
      "Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad.\n",
      "He asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?”\n",
      "They said to him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.” Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.”\n",
      "The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me,\n",
      "and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.\n",
      "Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.”\n",
      "Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.\n",
      "Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cup bearer.\n",
      "But remember me when it will be well with you, and please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.\n",
      "For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.”\n",
      "When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.\n",
      "In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.”\n",
      "Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days.\n",
      "Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.”\n",
      "On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.\n",
      "He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;\n",
      "but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.\n",
      "Yet the chief cup bearer didn’t remember Joseph, but forgot him.\n",
      "At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river.\n",
      "Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass.\n",
      "Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river.\n",
      "The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.\n",
      "He slept and dreamed a second time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good.\n",
      "Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.\n",
      "The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.\n",
      "In the morning, his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt’s magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.\n",
      "Then the chief cup bearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my faults today.\n",
      "Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker.\n",
      "We dreamed a dream in one night, I and he. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.\n",
      "There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to his dream he interpreted.\n",
      "As he interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.”\n",
      "Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.\n",
      "Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”\n",
      "Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It isn’t in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”\n",
      "Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river:\n",
      "and behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed in the marsh grass,\n",
      "and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.\n",
      "The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle,\n",
      "and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.\n",
      "I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good:\n",
      "and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.\n",
      "The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”\n",
      "Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.\n",
      "The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one.\n",
      "The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.\n",
      "That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh.\n",
      "Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "There will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,\n",
      "and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.\n",
      "The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.\n",
      "“Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years.\n",
      "Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.\n",
      "The food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine.”\n",
      "The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.\n",
      "Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?”\n",
      "Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has shown you all of this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you.\n",
      "You shall be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than you.”\n",
      "Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”\n",
      "Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck,\n",
      "and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.”\n",
      "Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly.\n",
      "He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was around every city, he laid up in the same.\n",
      "Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.\n",
      "To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.\n",
      "Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, “For”, he said, “God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.”\n",
      "The name of the second, he called Ephraim: “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”\n",
      "The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end.\n",
      "The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.\n",
      "When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.”\n",
      "The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.\n",
      "Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”\n",
      "He said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.”\n",
      "Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.\n",
      "But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to him.”\n",
      "The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.\n",
      "Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?” They said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”\n",
      "Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him.\n",
      "Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.”\n",
      "They said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.\n",
      "We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.”\n",
      "He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”\n",
      "They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.”\n",
      "Joseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’\n",
      "By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here.\n",
      "Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.”\n",
      "He put them all together into custody for three days.\n",
      "Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God.\n",
      "If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.\n",
      "Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.” They did so.\n",
      "They said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.”\n",
      "Reuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child, ’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.”\n",
      "They didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.\n",
      "He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.\n",
      "Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.\n",
      "They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.\n",
      "As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.\n",
      "He said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”\n",
      "They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,\n",
      "“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.\n",
      "We said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies.\n",
      "We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.’\n",
      "The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.\n",
      "Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’”\n",
      "As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.\n",
      "Jacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.”\n",
      "Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.”\n",
      "He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”\n",
      "The famine was severe in the land.\n",
      "When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.”\n",
      "Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’\n",
      "If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food,\n",
      "but if you’ll not send him, we’ll not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’”\n",
      "Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?”\n",
      "They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down?’”\n",
      "Judah said to Israel, his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.\n",
      "I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever,\n",
      "for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.”\n",
      "Their father, Israel, said to them, “If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;\n",
      "and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.\n",
      "Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.\n",
      "May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”\n",
      "The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.\n",
      "When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.”\n",
      "The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.\n",
      "The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we’re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.”\n",
      "They came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,\n",
      "and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.\n",
      "When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.\n",
      "We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in our sacks.”\n",
      "He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon out to them.\n",
      "The man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder.\n",
      "They prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.\n",
      "When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to him to the earth.\n",
      "He asked them of their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?”\n",
      "They said, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down humbly.\n",
      "He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”\n",
      "Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there.\n",
      "He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.”\n",
      "They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves, because the Egyptians don’t eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.\n",
      "They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled one with another.\n",
      "He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.\n",
      "He commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth.\n",
      "Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.” He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.\n",
      "As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.\n",
      "When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded evil for good?\n",
      "Isn’t this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.’”\n",
      "He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.\n",
      "They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!\n",
      "Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house?\n",
      "With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”\n",
      "He said, “Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my slave; and you will be blameless.”\n",
      "Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack.\n",
      "He searched, beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.\n",
      "Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.\n",
      "Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him.\n",
      "Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Don’t you know that such a man as I can indeed divine?”\n",
      "Judah said, “What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.”\n",
      "He said, “Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”\n",
      "Then Judah came near to him, and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.\n",
      "My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’\n",
      "We said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.’\n",
      "You said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’\n",
      "We said to my lord, ‘The boy can’t leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’\n",
      "You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.’\n",
      "When we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.\n",
      "Our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food.’\n",
      "We said, ‘We can’t go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother is with us.’\n",
      "Your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons:\n",
      "and the one went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces”; and I haven’t seen him since.\n",
      "If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.’\n",
      "Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up in the boy’s life;\n",
      "it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol.\n",
      "For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I don’t bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.’\n",
      "Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, my lord’s slave; and let the boy go up with his brothers.\n",
      "For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn’t with me?—lest I see the evil that will come on my father.”\n",
      "Then Joseph couldn’t control himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried, “Cause everyone to go out from me!” No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.\n",
      "He wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.\n",
      "Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Does my father still live?” His brothers couldn’t answer him; for they were terrified at his presence.\n",
      "Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.” They came near. “He said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.\n",
      "Now don’t be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.\n",
      "For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be no plowing and no harvest.\n",
      "God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.\n",
      "So now it wasn’t you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says, “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t wait.\n",
      "You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children’s children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.\n",
      "There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.”’\n",
      "Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.\n",
      "You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here.”\n",
      "He fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.\n",
      "He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.\n",
      "The report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.\n",
      "Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan.\n",
      "Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’\n",
      "Now you are commanded: do this. Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.\n",
      "Also, don’t concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.”\n",
      "The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.\n",
      "He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.\n",
      "He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.\n",
      "So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, “See that you don’t quarrel on the way.”\n",
      "They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father.\n",
      "They told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” His heart fainted, for he didn’t believe them.\n",
      "They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived.\n",
      "Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”\n",
      "Israel traveled with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac.\n",
      "God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, “Jacob, Jacob!” He said, “Here I am.”\n",
      "He said, “I am God, the God of your father. Don’t be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation.\n",
      "I will go down with you into Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph will close your eyes.”\n",
      "Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.\n",
      "They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt—Jacob, and all his offspring with him,\n",
      "his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and he brought all his offspring with him into Egypt.\n",
      "These are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.\n",

      "Joseph prepared his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.\n",

      "Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.\n",
      "Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many are the days of the years of your life?”\n",
      "Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.”\n",
      "Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.\n",
      "Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.\n",
      "Joseph nourished his father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household, with bread, according to their families.\n",
      "There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.\n",
      "Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.\n",
      "When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails.”\n",
      "Joseph said, “Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone.”\n",
      "They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year.\n",
      "When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.\n",
      "Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be desolate.”\n",
      "So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh’s.\n",
      "As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.\n",
      "Only he didn’t buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn’t sell their land.\n",
      "Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.\n",
      "It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.”\n",
      "They said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”\n",
      "Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become Pharaoh’s.\n",
      "Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.\n",
      "Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.\n",
      "The time drew near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt,\n",
      "but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place.” He said, “I will do as you have said.”\n",
      "He said, “Swear to me, ” and he swore to him. Israel bowed himself on the bed’s head.\n",
      "After these things, someone said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.\n",
      "Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you, ” and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.\n",
      "Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,\n",
      "and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’\n",
      "Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.\n",
      "Your issue, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.\n",
      "As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).”\n",
      "Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?”\n",
      "Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.”\n",
      "Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see. He brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.\n",
      "Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.”\n",
      "Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.\n",
      "Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him.\n",
      "Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.\n",
      "He blessed Joseph, and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,\n",
      "the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.”\n",
      "When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.\n",
      "Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”\n",
      "His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.”\n",
      "He blessed them that day, saying, “In you will Israel bless, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh’” He set Ephraim before Manasseh.\n",
      "Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.\n",
      "Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.”\n",
      "Jacob called to his sons, and said: “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come.\n",
      "Assemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob. Listen to Israel, your father.\n",
      "“Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength; excelling in dignity, and excelling in power.\n",
      "Boiling over like water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father’s bed, then defiled it. He went up to my couch.\n",
      "“Simeon and Levi are brothers. Their swords are weapons of violence.\n",
      "My soul, don’t come into their council. My glory, don’t be united to their assembly; for in their anger they killed men. In their self-will they hamstrung cattle.\n",
      "Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.\n",
      "“Judah, your brothers will praise you. Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies. Your father’s sons will bow down before you.\n",
      "Judah is a lion’s cub. From the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down, he crouched as a lion, as a lioness. Who will rouse him up?\n",
      "The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs. To him will the obedience of the peoples be.\n",
      "Binding his foal to the vine, his donkey’s colt to the choice vine; he has washed his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.\n",

      "But his bow remained strong. The arms of his hands were made strong, by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),\n",
      "even by the God of your father, who will help you; by the Almighty, who will bless you, with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.\n",
      "The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors, above the boundaries of the ancient hills. They will be on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers.\n",
      "“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf. In the morning he will devour the prey. At evening he will divide the plunder.”\n",
      "All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them. He blessed everyone according to his blessing.\n",
      "He instructed them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,\n",
      "in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place.\n",
      "There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah:\n",
      "the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.”\n",
      "When Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the spirit, and was gathered to his people.\n",
      "Joseph fell on his father’s face, wept on him, and kissed him.\n",
      "Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.\n",
      "Forty days were fulfilled for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians wept for him for seventy days.\n",
      "When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,\n",
      "‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.’”\n",
      "Pharaoh said, “Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.”\n",
      "Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,\n",
      "All the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.\n",
      "There went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.\n",
      "They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.\n",
      "When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.\n",
      "His sons did to him just as he commanded them,\n",
      "for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.\n",
      "Joseph returned into Egypt—he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.\n",
      "When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.”\n",
      "They sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before he died, saying,\n",
      "‘You shall tell Joseph, “Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.”’ Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him.\n",
      "His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, “Behold, we are your servants.”\n",
      "Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for am I in the place of God?\n",
      "As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive.\n",
      "Now therefore don’t be afraid. I will nourish you and your little ones.” He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.\n",
      "Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father’s house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years.\n",
      "Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph’s knees.\n",
      "Joseph said to his brothers, “I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”\n",
      "Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”\n",
      "So Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\n",
      "Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):\n",
      "Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,\n",
      "Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,\n",
      "Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.\n",
      "All the souls who came out of Jacob’s body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already.\n",
      "Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.\n",
      "The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.\n",
      "Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn’t know Joseph.\n",
      "He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.\n",
      "Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape out of the land.”\n",
      "Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.\n",
      "But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were grieved because of the children of Israel.\n",
      "The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,\n",
      "and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.\n",
      "The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,\n",
      "and he said, “When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool; if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.”\n",
      "But the midwives feared God, and didn’t do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive.\n",
      "The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and have saved the boys alive?”\n",
      "The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to them.”\n",
      "God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.\n",
      "Because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.\n",
      "Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.”\n",
      "A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife.\n",
      "The woman conceived, and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.\n",
      "When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank.\n",
      "His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him.\n",
      "Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to get it.\n",
      "She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”\n",
      "Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?”\n",
      "Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” The maiden went and called the child’s mother.\n",
      "Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” The woman took the child, and nursed it.\n",
      "The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.”\n",
      "In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.\n",
      "He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.\n",
      "He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?”\n",
      "He said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?” Moses was afraid, and said, “Surely this thing is known.”\n",
      "Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.\n",
      "Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.\n",
      "The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.\n",
      "When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, “How is it that you have returned so early today?”\n",
      "They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.”\n",
      "He said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”\n",
      "Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter.\n",
      "She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.”\n",
      "In the course of those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.\n",
      "God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\n",
      "God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them.\n",
      "Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God’s mountain, to Horeb.\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.\n",
      "Moses said, “I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.”\n",
      "When Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, “Moses! Moses!” He said, “Here I am.”\n",
      "He said, “Don’t come close. Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place you are standing on is holy ground.”\n",
      "Moreover he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.\n",
      "Yahweh said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.\n",
      "I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\n",
      "Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.\n",
      "Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”\n",
      "Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?”\n",
      "He said, “Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.”\n",
      "Moses said to God, “Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you; ’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ What should I tell them?”\n",
      "God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM, ” and he said, “You shall tell the children of Israel this: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”\n",
      "God said moreover to Moses, “You shall tell the children of Israel this, ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.\n",
      "Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;\n",
      "and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’\n",
      "They will listen to your voice, and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.’\n",
      "I know that the king of Egypt won’t give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand.\n",
      "I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do among them, and after that he will let you go.\n",
      "I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed.\n",
      "But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians.”\n",
      "Moses answered, “But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, ‘Yahweh has not appeared to you.’”\n",
      "Yahweh said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A rod.”\n",
      "He said, “Throw it on the ground.” He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail.” He stretched out his hand, and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand.\n",
      "“That they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”\n",
      "Yahweh said furthermore to him, “Now put your hand inside your cloak.” He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.\n",
      "He said, “Put your hand inside your cloak again.” He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.\n",
      "“It will happen, if they will not believe you or listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.\n",
      "It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.”\n",
      "Moses said to Yahweh, “O Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to him, “Who made man’s mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn’t it I, Yahweh?\n",
      "Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak.”\n",

      "Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!”\n",
      "Moses said, “You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go. When he lets you go, he will surely thrust you out altogether.\n",
      "Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man ask of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.”\n",
      "Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.\n",
      "Moses said, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘About midnight I will go out into the middle of Egypt,\n",
      "and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of livestock.\n",

      "All these servants of yours will come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, “Get out, with all the people who follow you”; and after that I will go out.’” He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Pharaoh won’t listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”\n",
      "Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he didn’t let the children of Israel go out of his land.\n",

      "“This month shall be to you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you.\n",
      "Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household;\n",
      "and if the household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls; according to what everyone can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.\n",
      "Your lamb shall be without defect, a male a year old. You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:\n",
      "and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening.\n",
      "They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two door posts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it.\n",
      "They shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread. They shall eat it with bitter herbs.\n",
      "Don’t eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts.\n",
      "You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.\n",
      "This is how you shall eat it: with your belt on your waist, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is Yahweh’s Passover.\n",
      "For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Yahweh.\n",
      "The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.\n",
      "This day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep it a feast to Yahweh: throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.\n",
      "“‘Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.\n",
      "In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no kind of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.\n",
      "You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.\n",
      "In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty first day of the month at evening.\n",
      "There shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a foreigner, or one who is born in the land.\n",
      "You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.’”\n",

      "For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two door posts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you.\n",
      "You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever.\n",
      "It shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service.\n",
      "It will happen, when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’\n",
      "that you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of Yahweh’s Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.’” The people bowed their heads and worshiped.\n",
      "The children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.\n",
      "At midnight, Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of livestock.\n",
      "Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.\n",
      "He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!\n",
      "Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!”\n",
      "The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We are all dead men.”\n",

      "The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing.\n",
      "Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. They plundered the Egyptians.\n",
      "The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.\n",
      "A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock.\n",
      "They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn’t leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn’t wait, and they had not prepared any food for themselves.\n",
      "Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.\n",
      "At the end of four hundred thirty years, to the day, all of Yahweh’s armies went out from the land of Egypt.\n",
      "It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Yahweh, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.\n",

      "When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.\n",
      "One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you.”\n",
      "All the children of Israel did so. As Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.\n",
      "That same day, Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "“Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal. It is mine.”\n",

      "It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.\n",

      "You shall tell your son in that day, saying, ‘It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt.’\n",
      "It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that Yahweh’s law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt.\n",
      "You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.\n",
      "“It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,\n",
      "that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal. The males shall be Yahweh’s.\n",
      "Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons.\n",
      "It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ that you shall tell him, ‘By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.\n",
      "When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of animal. Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’\n",
      "It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes: for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt.”\n",
      "When Pharaoh had let the people go, God didn’t lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt”;\n",
      "but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the children of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you.”\n",
      "They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.\n",
      "Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:\n",
      "the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn’t depart from before the people.\n",

      "“Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea.\n",
      "Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, ‘They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.’\n",
      "I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh.” They did so.\n",

      "The Egyptians pursued them. All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.\n",
      "When Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to Yahweh.\n",
      "They said to Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us out of Egypt?\n",
      "Isn’t this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?’ For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.”\n",
      "Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will work for you today: for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never see them again.\n",

      "The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.\n",
      "It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and one didn’t come near the other all night.\n",
      "Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\n",

      "In the morning watch, Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army.\n",
      "He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, “Let’s flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.”\n",
      "Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.\n",
      "The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh’s army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them.\n",
      "But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.\n",
      "Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.\n",
      "Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh, and in his servant Moses.\n",
      "Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh, and said, “I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.\n",
      "Yah is my strength and song. He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him; my father’s God, and I will exalt him.\n",

      "With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.\n",
      "The enemy said, ‘I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the plunder. My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.’\n",
      "You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.\n",
      "Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?\n",
      "You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.\n",

      "The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.\n",
      "Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.\n",
      "Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone— until your people pass over, Yahweh, until the people pass over who you have purchased.\n",

      "The people murmured against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?”\n",
      "Then he cried to Yahweh. Yahweh showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them;\n",
      "and he said, “If you will diligently listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you.”\n",

      "Moses said, “Now Yahweh shall give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you; because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh.”\n",
      "Moses said to Aaron, “Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come near before Yahweh, for he has heard your murmurings.’”\n",
      "As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, Yahweh’s glory appeared in the cloud.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "“I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread: and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God.’”\n",
      "In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.\n",
      "When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.\n",
      "When the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they didn’t know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat.”\n",
      "This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded: “Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.”\n",
      "The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.\n",
      "When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered every man according to his eating.\n",
      "Moses said to them, “Let no one leave of it until the morning.”\n",
      "Notwithstanding they didn’t listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them.\n",
      "They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted.\n",
      "On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.\n",
      "He said to them, “This is that which Yahweh has spoken, ‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’”\n",
      "They laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it didn’t become foul, and there were no worms in it.\n",
      "Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in the field.\n",
      "Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none.”\n",
      "On the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?\n",
      "Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.”\n",
      "So the people rested on the seventh day.\n",
      "The house of Israel called its name Manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.\n",
      "Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, ‘Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”\n",
      "Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations.”\n",
      "As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.\n",
      "The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.\n",
      "Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.\n",
      "All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to Yahweh’s commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink.\n",
      "Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?”\n",
      "The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?”\n",
      "Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go.\n",
      "Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.\n",
      "He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying, “Is Yahweh among us, or not?”\n",
      "Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.\n",
      "Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God’s rod in my hand.”\n",
      "So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.\n",
      "When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. When he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.\n",
      "But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset.\n",
      "Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky.”\n",
      "Moses built an altar, and called its name Yahweh our Banner.\n",
      "He said, “Yah has sworn: ‘Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.’”\n",
      "Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.\n",
      "Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,\n",
      "and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom, for Moses said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land”.\n",
      "The name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, “My father’s God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword.”\n",
      "Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God.\n",
      "He said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her.”\n",
      "Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.\n",
      "Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them.\n",
      "Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.\n",
      "Jethro said, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.\n",
      "Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them.”\n",
      "Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.\n",
      "On the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.\n",
      "When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, “What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?”\n",
      "Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.\n",
      "When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.”\n",
      "Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good.\n",
      "You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone.\n",
      "Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God.\n",
      "You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.\n",
      "Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men which fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.\n",
      "Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you.\n",
      "If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.”\n",
      "So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.\n",
      "Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.\n",
      "They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard causes to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n",
      "Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.\n",
      "In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.\n",
      "When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain.\n",
      "Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain, saying, “This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:\n",
      "‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to myself.\n",
      "Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;\n",
      "and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.”\n",
      "Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him.\n",
      "All the people answered together, and said, “All that Yahweh has spoken we will do.” Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.” Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,\n",
      "and be ready against the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.\n",
      "You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.\n",
      "No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.”\n",
      "Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.\n",
      "He said to the people, “Be ready by the third day. Don’t have sexual relations with a woman.”\n",
      "On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.\n",
      "Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.\n",
      "Mount Sinai, all it, smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.\n",
      "When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.\n",
      "Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.\n",
      "Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break out on them.”\n",
      "Moses said to Yahweh, “The people can’t come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.’”\n",
      "Yahweh said to him, “Go down! You shall bring Aaron up with you, but don’t let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he break out against them.”\n",
      "So Moses went down to the people, and told them.\n",
      "God spoke all these words, saying,\n",
      "“I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\n",
      "“You shall have no other gods before me.\n",
      "“You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:\n",
      "you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me,\n",
      "and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.\n",
      "“You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain, for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.\n",
      "“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\n",
      "You shall labor six days, and do all your work,\n",
      "but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates;\n",
      "for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy.\n",
      "“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.\n",
      "“You shall not murder.\n",
      "“You shall not commit adultery.\n",

      "All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance.\n",
      "They said to Moses, “Speak with us yourself, and we will listen; but don’t let God speak with us, lest we die.”\n",
      "Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his fear may be before you, that you won’t sin.”\n",
      "The people stayed at a distance, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “This is what you shall tell the children of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.\n",
      "You shall most certainly not make alongside of me gods of silver, or gods of gold for yourselves.\n",
      "You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you.\n",
      "If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.\n",
      "You shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.’\n",
      "“Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them.\n",
      "“If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything.\n",
      "If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself. If he is married, then his wife shall go out with him.\n",
      "If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.\n",
      "But if the servant shall plainly say, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children. I will not go out free; ’\n",
      "then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever.\n",
      "“If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not go out as the male servants do.\n",
      "If she doesn’t please her master, who has married her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her.\n",
      "If he marries her to his son, he shall deal with her as a daughter.\n",

      "if he rises again and walks around with his staff, then he who struck him shall be cleared: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for his healing until he is thoroughly healed.\n",
      "“If a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished.\n",
      "Notwithstanding, if he gets up after a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his property.\n",

      "You shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the Tent of Meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh, to make atonement for your souls.”\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "“You shall also make a basin of brass, and its base of brass, in which to wash. You shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.\n",
      "Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it.\n",
      "When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to Yahweh.\n",
      "So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die: and it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his descendants throughout their generations.”\n",
      "Moreover Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "“Also take fine spices: of liquid myrrh, five hundred shekels; and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, even two hundred and fifty; and of fragrant cane, two hundred and fifty;\n",
      "and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary; and a hin of olive oil.\n",
      "You shall make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.\n",
      "You shall use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the testimony,\n",
      "the table and all its articles, the lamp stand and its accessories, the altar of incense,\n",
      "the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its base.\n",
      "You shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy.\n",
      "You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest’s office.\n",
      "You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘This shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations.\n",

      "Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.’”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Take to yourself sweet spices, gum resin, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: there shall be an equal weight of each;\n",
      "and you shall make incense of it, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:\n",
      "and you shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before the testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be to you most holy.\n",
      "The incense which you shall make, according to its composition you shall not make for yourselves: it shall be to you holy for Yahweh.\n",
      "Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it, he shall be cut off from his people.”\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "“Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:\n",
      "and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship,\n",

      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "“Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.\n",
      "You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\n",
      "Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.\n",
      "It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.’”\n",
      "He gave to Moses, when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with God’s finger.\n",
      "When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.”\n",
      "Aaron said to them, “Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.”\n",
      "All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.\n",
      "He received what they handed him, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, “These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”\n",
      "When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.”\n",
      "They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!\n",
      "They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.\n",
      "Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.”\n",
      "Moses begged Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?\n",
      "Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.\n",
      "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’”\n",
      "Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.\n",
      "Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written.\n",
      "The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.\n",
      "When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the noise of war in the camp.”\n",
      "He said, “It isn’t the voice of those who shout for victory. It is not the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear.”\n",
      "As soon as he came near to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Then Moses’ anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.\n",
      "He took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.\n",
      "Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?”\n",
      "Aaron said, “Don’t let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.\n",
      "For they said to me, ‘Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.’\n",
      "I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them take it off: ’ so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”\n",
      "When Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies),\n",
      "then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on Yahweh’s side, come to me!” All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.\n",
      "He said to them, “Yahweh says, the God of Israel, ‘Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.’”\n",
      "The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\n",
      "Moses said, “Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day.”\n",
      "On the next day, Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.”\n",
      "Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, “Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.\n",
      "Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.\n",
      "Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin.”\n",
      "Yahweh struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’\n",
      "I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:\n",
      "to a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you on the way.”\n",
      "When the people heard this evil news, they mourned: and no one put on his jewelry.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Tell the children of Israel, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up into the middle of you for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.’”\n",
      "The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.\n",
      "Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it “The Tent of Meeting.” Everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.\n",
      "When Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent.\n",
      "When Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and spoke with Moses.\n",
      "All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn’t depart from the Tent.\n",
      "Moses said to Yahweh, “Behold, you tell me, ‘Bring up this people: ’ and you haven’t let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’\n",
      "Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people.”\n",
      "He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”\n",
      "He said to him, “If your presence doesn’t go with me, don’t carry us up from here.\n",
      "For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn’t it in that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.”\n",
      "He said, “Please show me your glory.”\n",
      "He said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim Yahweh’s name before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.”\n",
      "He said, “You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live.”\n",
      "Yahweh also said, “Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock.\n",
      "It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;\n",
      "then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Chisel two stone tablets like the first: and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.\n",
      "Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.\n",
      "No one shall come up with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain. Do not let the flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain.”\n",
      "He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets.\n",
      "Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed Yahweh’s name.\n",
      "Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, “Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,\n",
      "keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children’s children, on the third and on the fourth generation.”\n",
      "Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.\n",
      "He said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go among us; although this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.”\n",
      "He said, “Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you.\n",

      "Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare in the middle of you:\n",
      "but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherah poles;\n",
      "for you shall worship no other god: for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.\n",
      "“Don’t make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;\n",

      "“You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.\n",
      "“You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out of Egypt.\n",
      "“All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep.\n",
      "You shall redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb. If you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear before me empty.\n",

      "Moses answered them, “Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning you.”\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "“Say to the children of Israel, ‘If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh.\n",
      "In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.\n",
      "They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it.\n",
      "But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Because he didn’t offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.\n",
      "“‘If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover to Yahweh; according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him who is born in the land.’”\n",
      "On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony: and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.\n",
      "So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.\n",
      "Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped.\n",
      "At the commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel traveled, and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped.\n",
      "When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept Yahweh’s command, and didn’t travel.\n",
      "Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled.\n",
      "Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled: or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.\n",
      "Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Israel remained encamped, and didn’t travel; but when it was taken up, they traveled.\n",
      "At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment of Yahweh they traveled. They kept Yahweh’s command, at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "“Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.\n",
      "When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.\n",
      "If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.\n",
      "When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.\n",
      "When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.\n",
      "But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.\n",
      "“The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.\n",
      "When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.\n",
      "“Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am Yahweh your God.”\n",
      "In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.\n",
      "The children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran.\n",
      "They first went forward according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.\n",
      "First, the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies. Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army.\n",
      "Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar.\n",
      "Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun.\n",
      "The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward.\n",
      "The standard of the camp of Reuben went forward according to their armies. Elizur the son of Shedeur was over his army.\n",
      "Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon.\n",
      "Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad.\n",
      "The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary. The others set up the tabernacle before they arrived.\n",
      "The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies. Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army.\n",
      "Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh.\n",
      "Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin.\n",
      "The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their armies. Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army.\n",
      "Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher.\n",
      "Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali.\n",
      "Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies; and they went forward.\n",
      "Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well; for Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel.”\n",
      "He said to him, “I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives.”\n",
      "He said, “Don’t leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.\n",
      "It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever good Yahweh does to us, we will do the same to you.”\n",
      "They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days’ journey. The ark of the covenant of Yahweh went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.\n",
      "The cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.\n",
      "When the ark went forward, Moses said, “Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be scattered! Let those who hate you flee before you!”\n",
      "When it rested, he said, “Return, Yahweh, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.”\n",
      "The people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh. When Yahweh heard it, his anger was kindled; and Yahweh’s fire burnt among them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.\n",
      "The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated.\n",
      "The name of that place was called Taberah, because Yahweh’s fire burnt among them.\n",
      "The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, “Who will give us flesh to eat?\n",
      "We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;\n",
      "but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at.”\n",
      "The manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.\n",
      "The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.\n",
      "When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.\n",
      "Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and Yahweh’s anger was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.\n",
      "Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you treated with your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?\n",

      "Moses went out, and told the people Yahweh’s words; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent.\n",
      "Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.\n",
      "But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.\n",
      "A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”\n",
      "Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, “My lord Moses, forbid them!”\n",

      "A wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.\n",
      "The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them all out for themselves around the camp.\n",
      "While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, Yahweh’s anger was kindled against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague.\n",
      "The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.\n",

      "My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house.\n",
      "With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see Yahweh’s form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?”\n",
      "Yahweh’s anger was kindled against them; and he departed.\n",
      "The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.\n",
      "Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, please don’t count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.\n",
      "Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”\n",

      "Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.\n",
      "Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.\n",
      "These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.\n",
      "Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country.\n",
      "See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;\n",
      "and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;\n",
      "and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.\n",
      "So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.\n",
      "They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)\n",
      "They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs.\n",
      "That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there.\n",
      "They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.\n",
      "They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the land.\n",
      "They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us. Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.\n",
      "However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.\n",
      "Amalek dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.”\n",
      "Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!”\n",
      "But the men who went up with him said, “We aren’t able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.”\n",
      "They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature.\n",
      "There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim. We were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.”\n",
      "All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.\n",
      "All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, “We wish that we had died in the land of Egypt, or that we had died in this wilderness!\n",
      "Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be captured or killed! Wouldn’t it be better for us to return into Egypt?”\n",
      "They said to one another, “Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.”\n",
      "Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.\n",
      "Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes.\n",
      "They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.\n",
      "If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.\n",
      "Only don’t rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us. Their defense is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us. Don’t fear them.”\n",

      "On the next day, Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, Aaron’s rod for the house of Levi had sprouted, budded, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.\n",
      "Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel. They looked, and each man took his rod.\n",

      "Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel.\n",
      "Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.\n",
      "Israel took all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its towns.\n",
      "For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.\n",
      "Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, “Come to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established;\n",
      "for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon.\n",
      "Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.\n",
      "We have shot at them. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon. We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba.”\n",
      "Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.\n",
      "Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there.\n",
      "They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Don’t fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people, and his land. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”\n",
      "So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were no survivors; and they possessed his land.\n",
      "The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.\n",
      "Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.\n",
      "Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many. Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.\n",
      "Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.\n",
      "He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me.\n",
      "Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”\n",
      "The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand. They came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.\n",
      "He said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me.” The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.\n",
      "God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?”\n",
      "Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me,\n",
      "‘Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt covers the surface of the earth. Now, come curse me them. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.’”\n",
      "God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people; for they are blessed.”\n",
      "Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you.”\n",
      "The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”\n",
      "Balak again sent princes, more, and more honorable than they.\n",
      "They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,\n",
      "for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.’”\n",
      "Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.\n",
      "Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more.”\n",
      "God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.”\n",
      "Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.\n",
      "God’s anger was kindled because he went; and Yahweh’s angel placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.\n",
      "The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field. Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s angel stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.\n",
      "The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. He struck her again.\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.\n",
      "The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she lay down under Balaam. Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.\n",
      "Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”\n",
      "Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.”\n",
      "The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?” He said, “No.”\n",
      "Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me.\n",
      "The donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive.”\n",
      "Balaam said to Yahweh’s angel, “I have sinned; for I didn’t know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again.”\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.\n",
      "When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.\n",
      "Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?”\n",
      "Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.”\n",
      "Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.\n",
      "Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him.\n",
      "In the morning, Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there part of the people.\n",
      "Balaam said to Balak, “Build here seven altars for me, and prepare here seven bulls and seven rams for me.”\n",
      "Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram.\n",
      "Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.” He went to a bare height.\n",
      "God met Balaam, and he said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.”\n",
      "Yahweh put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”\n",
      "He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.\n",
      "He took up his parable, and said, “From Aram has Balak brought me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me. Come, defy Israel.\n",
      "How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? How shall I defy whom Yahweh has not defied?\n",
      "For from the top of the rocks I see him. From the hills I see him. Behold, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.\n",
      "Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous! Let my last end be like his!”\n",
      "Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether.”\n",
      "He answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?”\n",
      "Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, where you may see them. You shall see just part of them, and shall not see them all. Curse them from there for me.”\n",
      "He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.\n",
      "He said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet over there.”\n",
      "Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and say this.”\n",
      "He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?”\n",
      "He took up his parable, and said, “Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, you son of Zippor.\n",
      "God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?\n",
      "Behold, I have received a command to bless. He has blessed, and I can’t reverse it.\n",
      "He has not seen iniquity in Jacob. Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel. Yahweh his God is with him. The shout of a king is among them.\n",
      "God brings them out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.\n",
      "Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel. Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, ‘What has God done!’\n",
      "Behold, the people rises up as a lioness. As a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain.”\n",
      "Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.”\n",
      "But Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘All that Yahweh speaks, that I must do?’”\n",
      "Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”\n",
      "Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert.\n",
      "Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”\n",
      "Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.\n",
      "When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he didn’t go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.\n",
      "Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him.\n",
      "He took up his parable, and said, “Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eyes are open says;\n",
      "he says, who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open:\n",
      "How goodly are your tents, Jacob, and your tents, Israel!\n",
      "As valleys they are spread out, as gardens by the riverside, as aloes which Yahweh has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters.\n",
      "Water shall flow from his buckets. His seed shall be in many waters. His king shall be higher than Agag. His kingdom shall be exalted.\n",
      "God brings him out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them with his arrows.\n",
      "He couched, he lay down as a lion, as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Everyone who blesses you is blessed. Everyone who curses you is cursed.”\n",
      "Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.\n",
      "Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you back from honor.”\n",
      "Balaam said to Balak, “Didn’t I also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying,\n",
      "‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond Yahweh’s word, to do either good or bad of my own mind. I will say what Yahweh says’?\n",
      "Now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.”\n",
      "He took up his parable, and said, “Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eyes are open says;\n",
      "he says, who hears the words of God, knows the knowledge of the Most High, and who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:\n",
      "I see him, but not now. I see him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob. A scepter will rise out of Israel, and shall strike through the corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of Sheth.\n",
      "Edom shall be a possession. Seir, his enemies, also shall be a possession, while Israel does valiantly.\n",
      "Out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city.”\n",
      "He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, “Amalek was the first of the nations, But his latter end shall come to destruction.”\n",
      "He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, “Your dwelling place is strong. Your nest is set in the rock.\n",
      "Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur carries you away captive.”\n",
      "He took up his parable, and said, “Alas, who shall live when God does this?\n",
      "But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim. They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber. He also shall come to destruction.”\n",
      "Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.\n",
      "Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab;\n",
      "for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods. The people ate and bowed down to their gods.\n",
      "Israel joined himself to Baal Peor. Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.”\n",
      "Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.”\n",
      "Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting.\n",
      "When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the middle of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand.\n",
      "He went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.\n",
      "Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "“Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I didn’t consume the children of Israel in my jealousy.\n",
      "Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.\n",
      "It shall be to him, and to his offspring after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.’”\n",
      "Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among the Simeonites.\n",
      "The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,\n",
      "“Harass the Midianites, and strike them,\n",
      "for they harassed you with their wiles, with which they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.”\n",
      "After the plague, Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,\n",
      "“Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ houses, all who are able to go out to war in Israel.”\n",
      "Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,\n",

      "Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.\n",
      "Yahweh said to me, “Don’t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his people, and his land, into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”\n",
      "So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people. We struck him until no one was left to him remaining.\n",
      "We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.\n",
      "All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides a great many towns without walls.\n",
      "We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.\n",
      "But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves.\n",
      "We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon.\n",
      "(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.)\n",
      "We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.\n",
      "(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a man.)\n",
      "This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:\n",
      "and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.\n",
      "Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.)\n",
      "I gave Gilead to Machir.\n",
      "To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;\n",
      "the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.\n",
      "I commanded you at that time, saying, “Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it. You shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all the men of valor.\n",
      "But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,\n",
      "until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then you shall each return to his own possession, which I have given you.”\n",
      "I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings. So shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.\n",
      "You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God himself fights for you.”\n",
      "I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,\n",
      "“Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do works like yours, and mighty acts like yours?\n",
      "Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.”\n",
      "But Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and didn’t listen to me. Yahweh said to me, “Let this satisfy you. Speak no more to me of this matter.\n",
      "Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan.\n",
      "But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.”\n",
      "So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.\n",
      "Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, gives you.\n",
      "You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you.\n",
      "Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for all the men who followed Baal Peor, Yahweh your God has destroyed them from among you.\n",
      "But you who were faithful to Yahweh your God are all alive this day.\n",
      "Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should do so in the middle of the land where you go in to possess it.\n",
      "Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”\n",
      "For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them, as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him?\n",
      "What great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?\n",
      "Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children;\n",
      "the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, “Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.”\n",
      "You came near and stood under the mountain. The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice.\n",
      "He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets.\n",
      "Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.\n",
      "Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire,\n",
      "lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,\n",
      "the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,\n",
      "the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;\n",
      "and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky.\n",
      "But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day.\n",
      "Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance;\n",
      "but I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go over, and possess that good land.\n",
      "Be careful, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he made with you, and make yourselves an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.\n",
      "For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.\n",
      "When you shall father children, and children’s children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, to provoke him to anger;\n",
      "I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan to possess it. You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed.\n",
      "Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh will lead you away.\n",
      "There you shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.\n",
      "But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.\n",
      "When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God, and listen to his voice.\n",
      "For Yahweh your God is a merciful God. He will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.\n",
      "For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?\n",
      "Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?\n",
      "Or has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from among another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?\n",
      "It was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is God. There is no one else besides him.\n",
      "Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.\n",
      "Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;\n",
      "to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day.\n",
      "Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh himself is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no one else.\n",
      "You shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.\n",
      "Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;\n",
      "that the man slayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and didn’t hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:\n",
      "Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.\n",
      "This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.\n",
      "These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt,\n",
      "beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they came out of Egypt.\n",
      "They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;\n",
      "from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (also called Hermon),\n",
      "and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.\n",
      "Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, “Hear, Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.”\n",
      "Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.\n",
      "Yahweh didn’t make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the middle of the fire,\n",
      "(I stood between Yahweh and you at that time, to show you Yahweh’s word: for you were afraid because of the fire, and didn’t go up onto the mountain; ) saying,\n",
      "“I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\n",
      "“You shall have no other gods before me.\n",
      "“You shall not make an engraved image for yourself, any likeness of what is in heaven above, or what is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\n",
      "You shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them; for I, Yahweh, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me;\n",
      "and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.\n",
      "“You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain: for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.\n",
      "“Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you.\n",
      "You shall labor six days, and do all your work;\n",
      "but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God, in which you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.\n",
      "You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm. Therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.\n",
      "“Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.\n",
      "“You shall not murder.\n",
      "“You shall not commit adultery.\n",
      "“You shall not steal.\n",
      "“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.\n",
      "“You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. Neither shall you desire your neighbor’s house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.”\n",
      "Yahweh spoke these words to all your assembly on the mountain out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice. He added no more. He wrote them on two stone tablets, and gave them to me.\n",
      "When you heard the voice out of the middle of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;\n",
      "and you said, “Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the middle of the fire. We have seen this day that God does speak with man, and he lives.\n",
      "Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more, then we shall die.\n",
      "For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as we have, and lived?\n",
      "Go near, and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say, and tell us all that Yahweh our God tells you; and we will hear it, and do it.”\n",
      "Yahweh heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and Yahweh said to me, “I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They have well said all that they have spoken.\n",
      "Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children forever!\n",
      "“Go tell them, ‘Return to your tents.’\n",
      "But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.”\n",
      "You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you. You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.\n",
      "You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.\n",
      "Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it;\n",
      "that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you; you, and your son, and your son’s son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.\n",
      "Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.\n",
      "Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God. Yahweh is one.\n",
      "You shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.\n",
      "These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart;\n",
      "and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.\n",
      "You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.\n",
      "You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates.\n",
      "It shall be, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn’t build,\n",
      "and houses full of all good things, which you didn’t fill, and cisterns dug out, which you didn’t dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn’t plant, and you shall eat and be full;\n",
      "then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\n",
      "You shall fear Yahweh your God; and you shall serve him, and shall swear by his name.\n",
      "You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around you;\n",
      "for Yahweh your God among you is a jealous God; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.\n",
      "You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah.\n",
      "You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.\n",
      "You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh; that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,\n",
      "to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.\n",
      "When your son asks you in time to come, saying, “What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh our God has commanded you mean?”\n",
      "then you shall tell your son, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt. Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;\n",
      "and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;\n",
      "and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.\n",
      "Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.\n",
      "It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.”\n",
      "When Yahweh your God brings you into the land where you go to possess it, and casts out many nations before you, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you;\n",
      "and when Yahweh your God delivers them up before you, and you strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them;\n",
      "neither shall you make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son.\n",
      "For he will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods. So Yahweh’s anger would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.\n",
      "But you shall deal with them like this. You shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, and cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their engraved images with fire.\n",
      "For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God. Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.\n",
      "Yahweh didn’t set his love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples:\n",
      "but because Yahweh loves you, and because he desires to keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, Yahweh has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.\n",
      "Know therefore that Yahweh your God himself is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,\n",
      "and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face.\n",
      "You shall therefore keep the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.\n",
      "It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers.\n",
      "He will love you, bless you, multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.\n",
      "You shall be blessed above all peoples. There shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.\n",
      "Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, will he put on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you.\n",
      "You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you. Your eye shall not pity them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that would be a snare to you.\n",
      "If you shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?”\n",
      "you shall not be afraid of them. You shall remember well what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;\n",
      "the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out. So shall Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.\n",
      "Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.\n",
      "You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is among you, a great and awesome God.\n",
      "Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you little by little. You may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.\n",
      "But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they are destroyed.\n",
      "He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under the sky. No one will be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.\n",
      "You shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God.\n",
      "You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.\n",
      "You shall observe to do all the commandments which I command you this day, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers.\n",
      "You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not.\n",
      "He humbled you, and allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna, which you didn’t know, neither did your fathers know; that he might teach you that man does not live by bread only, but man lives by every word that proceeds out of Yahweh’s mouth.\n",
      "Your clothing didn’t grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.\n",
      "You shall consider in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so Yahweh your God disciplines you.\n",
      "You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.\n",
      "For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills;\n",
      "a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey;\n",
      "a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper.\n",
      "You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your God for the good land which he has given you.\n",
      "Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command you this day;\n",
      "lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built fine houses, and lived in them;\n",
      "and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;\n",
      "then your heart might be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;\n",
      "who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who poured water for you out of the rock of flint;\n",
      "who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn’t know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end:\n",
      "and lest you say in your heart, “My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.”\n",
      "But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as at this day.\n",
      "It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish.\n",
      "As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you wouldn’t listen to Yahweh your God’s voice.\n",
      "Hear, Israel! You are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,\n",

      "Know therefore this day, that Yahweh your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you. So you shall drive them out, and make them perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you.\n",
      "Don’t say in your heart, after Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, “For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land”; because Yahweh drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations.\n",
      "Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n",
      "Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn’t give you this good land to possess for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.\n",
      "Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.\n",
      "Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you.\n",
      "When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.\n",
      "Yahweh delivered to me the two stone tablets written with the finger of God On them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly.\n",
      "It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant.\n",
      "Yahweh said to me, “Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them. They have made a molten image for themselves!”\n",
      "Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.\n",
      "Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.”\n",
      "So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.\n",
      "I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God. You had made yourselves a molten calf. You had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.\n",
      "I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.\n",
      "I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.\n",
      "For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also.\n",
      "Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.\n",
      "I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain.\n",
      "At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked Yahweh to wrath.\n",
      "When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you, ” you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn’t believe him, nor listen to his voice.\n",
      "You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you.\n",
      "So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you.\n",
      "I prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, don’t destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.\n",
      "Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin,\n",
      "lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’\n",
      "Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.”\n",
      "At that time Yahweh said to me, “Cut two stone tablets like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood.\n",
      "I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.”\n",
      "So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tables in my hand.\n",
      "He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Yahweh gave them to me.\n",
      "I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me.\n",
      "(The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his place.\n",
      "From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.\n",
      "At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.\n",
      "Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God spoke to him.)\n",
      "I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Yahweh listened to me that time also; Yahweh would not destroy you.\n",
      "Yahweh said to me, “Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.”\n",
      "Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul,\n",
      "to keep Yahweh’s commandments and statutes, which I command you this day for your good?\n",
      "Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.\n",
      "Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their offspring after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.\n",
      "Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.\n",
      "For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn’t respect persons, nor takes reward.\n",
      "He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing.\n",
      "Therefore love the foreigner; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "You shall fear Yahweh your God; you shall serve him; and you shall cling to him, and you shall swear by his name.\n",
      "He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen.\n",
      "Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude.\n",
      "Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his instructions, his statutes, his ordinances, and his commandments, always.\n",
      "Know this day: for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm,\n",
      "his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;\n",
      "and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;\n",
      "and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place;\n",
      "and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the middle of all Israel;\n",

      "and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey.\n",
      "For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn’t as the land of Egypt, that you came out of, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;\n",
      "but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from the rain of the sky,\n",
      "a land which Yahweh your God cares for. Yahweh your God’s eyes are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.\n",
      "It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,\n",

      "Therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul. You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.\n",
      "You shall teach them your children, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.\n",
      "You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates;\n",
      "that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.\n",
      "For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him;\n",
      "then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.\n",
      "Every place whereon the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the western sea shall be your border.\n",

      "You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.\n",
      "These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth.\n",
      "You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree.\n",

      "You shall eat no leavened bread with it. You shall eat unleavened bread with it seven days, even the bread of affliction; for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste; that you may remember the day when you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.\n",
      "No yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning.\n",
      "You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you;\n",
      "but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came out of Egypt.\n",
      "You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God chooses. In the morning you shall return to your tents.\n",
      "Six days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God. You shall do no work.\n",

      "You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give, according as Yahweh your God blesses you.\n",
      "You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God: you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite who is within your gates, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are among you, in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.\n",
      "You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt. You shall observe and do these statutes.\n",

      "You shall rejoice in your feast, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates.\n",
      "You shall keep a feast to Yahweh your God seven days in the place which Yahweh chooses; because Yahweh your God will bless you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful.\n",
      "Three times in a year all of your shall males appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he chooses: in the feast of unleavened bread, in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tents. They shall not appear before Yahweh empty.\n",
      "Every man shall give as he is able, according to Yahweh your God’s blessing which he has given you.\n",
      "You shall make judges and officers in all your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.\n",
      "You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality. You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous.\n",
      "You shall follow that which is altogether just, that you may live, and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you.\n",

      "and you are told, and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Israel,\n",
      "then you shall bring out that man or that woman, who has done this evil thing, to your gates, even that same man or woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones.\n",
      "At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death. At the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.\n",
      "The hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall remove the evil from among you.\n",
      "If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates; then you shall arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh your God chooses.\n",

      "The man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die. You shall put away the evil from Israel.\n",
      "All the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.\n",
      "When you have come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and possess it, and dwell in it, and say, “I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me”;\n",
      "you shall surely set him king over yourselves, whom Yahweh your God chooses. You shall set as king over you one from among your brothers. You may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother.\n",
      "Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; because Yahweh has said to you, “You shall not go back that way again.”\n",
      "He shall not multiply wives to himself, that his heart not turn away. He shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.\n",
      "It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write himself a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites.\n",
      "It shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them;\n",
      "that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not turn aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left; to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the middle of Israel.\n",
      "The priests the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel. They shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire and his portion.\n",
      "They shall have no inheritance among their brothers. Yahweh is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them.\n",
      "This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the inner parts.\n",
      "The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him.\n",
      "For Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in Yahweh’s name, him and his sons for ever.\n",
      "If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel, where he lives as a foreigner, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose;\n",

      "They shall have like portions to eat, in addition to that which comes from the sale of his family possessions.\n",
      "When you have come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not learn to imitate the abominations of those nations.\n",
      "There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,\n",
      "or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.\n",
      "For whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh. Because of these abominations, Yahweh your God drives them out from before you.\n",
      "You shall be perfect with Yahweh your God.\n",
      "For these nations that you shall dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery and to diviners; but as for you, Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do.\n",
      "Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from among you, of your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him.\n",

      "It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.\n",
      "But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.”\n",
      "You may say in your heart, “How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?”\n",
      "When a prophet speaks in Yahweh’s name, if the thing doesn’t follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him.\n",
      "When Yahweh your God cuts off the nations, whose land Yahweh your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;\n",
      "you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the middle of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.\n",
      "You shall prepare the way, and divide the borders of your land, which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every man slayer may flee there.\n",
      "This is the case of the man slayer who shall flee there and live. Whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and didn’t hate him in time past;\n",
      "as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle, and lights on his neighbor, so that he dies, he shall flee to one of these cities and live.\n",
      "Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the man slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally; even though he was not worthy of death, because he didn’t hate him in time past.\n",
      "Therefore I command you to set apart three cities for yourselves.\n",
      "If Yahweh your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers;\n",
      "if you keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever in his ways; then you shall add three cities more for yourselves, besides these three.\n",
      "This is so that innocent blood will not be shed in the middle of your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, leaving blood guilt on you.\n",
      "But if any man hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises up against him, strikes him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities;\n",
      "then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.\n",
      "Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.\n",
      "You shall not remove your neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess.\n",
      "One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.\n",
      "If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing,\n",
      "then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days;\n",
      "and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother;\n",
      "then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother. So you shall remove the evil from among you.\n",
      "Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and will never again commit any such evil among you.\n",
      "Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.\n",
      "When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,\n",
      "and shall tell them, “Hear, Israel, you draw near this day to battle against your enemies. Don’t let your heart faint! Don’t be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;\n",
      "for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.”\n",
      "The officers shall speak to the people, saying, “What man is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.\n",
      "What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit.\n",
      "What man is there who has pledged to be married a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.”\n",
      "The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, “What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brother’s heart melt as his heart.”\n",
      "It shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people.\n",
      "When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.\n",
      "It shall be, if it makes you answer of peace, and opens to you, then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein shall become forced laborers to you, and shall serve you.\n",
      "If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it.\n",
      "When Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword;\n",
      "but the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its plunder, you shall take for plunder for yourself. You may use the plunder of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you.\n",
      "Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.\n",
      "But of the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;\n",
      "but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Yahweh your God has commanded you;\n",
      "that they not teach you to follow all their abominations, which they have done to their gods; so would you sin against Yahweh your God.\n",
      "When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; for you may eat of them. You shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged by you?\n",
      "Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down. You shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.\n",
      "If someone is found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess, lying in the field, and it isn’t known who has struck him;\n",
      "then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain.\n",
      "It shall be that the elders of the city which is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn’t been worked with, and which has not drawn in the yoke.\n",
      "The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.\n",
      "The priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Yahweh your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in Yahweh’s name; and according to their word shall every controversy and every assault be decided.\n",
      "All the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.\n",
      "They shall answer and say, “Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.\n",
      "Forgive, Yahweh, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don’t allow innocent blood among your people Israel.” The blood shall be forgiven them.\n",
      "So you shall put away the innocent blood from among you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.\n",
      "When you go out to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry them away captive,\n",
      "and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have a desire to her, and desire to take her as your wife;\n",
      "then you shall bring her home to your house. She shall shave her head and trim her nails.\n",
      "She shall take the clothing of her captivity off of herself, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month. After that you shall go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.\n",
      "It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she desires; but you shall not sell her at all for money. You shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her.\n",
      "If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son is hers who was hated;\n",
      "then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not give the son of the beloved the rights of the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn;\n",
      "but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his.\n",
      "If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not listen to them;\n",
      "then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place.\n",
      "They shall tell the elders of his city, “This our son is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”\n",
      "All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall remove the evil from among you. All Israel shall hear, and fear.\n",
      "If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree;\n",
      "his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God; that you don’t defile your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.\n",
      "You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them. You shall surely bring them again to your brother.\n",
      "If your brother isn’t near to you, or if you don’t know him, then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall be with you until your brother comes looking for it, and you shall restore it to him.\n",
      "So you shall do with his donkey. So you shall do with his garment. So you shall do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost, and you have found. You may not hide yourself.\n",
      "You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them. You shall surely help him to lift them up again.\n",
      "A woman shall not wear men’s clothing, neither shall a man put on women’s clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God.\n",
      "If you come across a bird’s nest on the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young.\n",
      "You shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take for yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.\n",
      "When you build a new house, then you shall make a railing around your roof, so that you don’t bring blood on your house if anyone falls from there.\n",
      "You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest all the fruit be defiled, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.\n",
      "You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.\n",
      "You shall not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.\n",
      "You shall make yourselves fringes on the four corners of your cloak with which you cover yourself.\n",
      "If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, hates her,\n",
      "accuses her of shameful things, and gives her a bad name, and says, “I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I didn’t find in her the tokens of virginity”;\n",
      "then the young lady’s father and mother shall take and bring the tokens of the young lady’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.\n",
      "The young lady’s father shall tell the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man as his wife, and he hates her.\n",
      "Behold, he has accused her of shameful things, saying, ‘I didn’t find in your daughter the tokens of virginity; ’ and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity.” They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.\n",
      "The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him.\n",
      "They shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has given a bad name to a virgin of Israel. She shall be his wife. He may not put her away all his days.\n",
      "But if this thing is true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady;\n",
      "then they shall bring out the young lady to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done folly in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father’s house. So you shall remove the evil from among you.\n",
      "If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both die, the man who lay with the woman and the woman. So you shall remove the evil from Israel.\n",
      "If there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband, and a man finds her in the city, and lies with her;\n",
      "then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the lady, because she didn’t cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor’s wife. So you shall remove the evil from among you.\n",
      "But if the man finds the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man forces her, and lies with her; then only the man who lay with her shall die;\n",
      "but to the lady you shall do nothing. There is in the lady no sin worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter;\n",
      "for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was no one to save her.\n",
      "If a man finds a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, grabs her, and lies with her, and they are found;\n",

      "An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into Yahweh’s assembly; even to the tenth generation shall no one belonging to them enter into Yahweh’s assembly forever;\n",
      "because they didn’t meet you with bread and with water on the way, when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.\n",
      "Nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn’t listen to Balaam; but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because Yahweh your God loved you.\n",
      "You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever.\n",
      "You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother. You shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in his land.\n",

      "You shall have a place also outside of the camp where you go relieve yourself.\n",
      "You shall have a trowel among your weapons. It shall be, when you relieve yourself, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement;\n",
      "for Yahweh your God walks in the middle of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you. Therefore your camp shall be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.\n",
      "You shall not deliver to his master a servant who has escaped from his master to you.\n",

      "You shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest.\n",
      "You may lend on interest to a foreigner; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest, that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it.\n",
      "When you vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack to pay it; for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.\n",
      "But if you refrain from making a vow, it shall be no sin in you.\n",
      "You shall observe and do that which has gone out of your lips. Whatever you have vowed to Yahweh your God as a freewill offering, which you have promised with your mouth, you must do.\n",

      "The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.\n",
      "It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where Yahweh your God has driven you,\n",
      "and return to Yahweh your God, and obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;\n",
      "that then Yahweh your God will release you from captivity, have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples where Yahweh your God has scattered you.\n",
      "If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there Yahweh your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back.\n",
      "Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you will possess it. He will do you good, and increase your numbers more than your fathers.\n",
      "Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your offspring, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.\n",
      "Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.\n",
      "You shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his commandments which I command you this day.\n",
      "Yahweh your God will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good; for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers;\n",
      "if you will obey Yahweh your God’s voice, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.\n",
      "For this commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you or too distant.\n",
      "It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?”\n",
      "Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?”\n",
      "But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it.\n",
      "Behold, I have set before you this day life and prosperity, and death and evil.\n",
      "For I command you this day to love Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it.\n",
      "But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;\n",
      "I denounce to you this day, that you will surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it.\n",
      "I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your descendants;\n",
      "to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.\n",
      "Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.\n",
      "He said to them, “I am one hundred twenty years old this day. I can no more go out and come in. Yahweh has said to me, ‘You shall not go over this Jordan.’\n",
      "Yahweh your God himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua will go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.\n",
      "Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed.\n",
      "Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.\n",
      "Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or scared of them; for Yahweh your God himself is who goes with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you.”\n",
      "Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.\n",
      "Yahweh himself is who goes before you. He will be with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be discouraged.”\n",
      "Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and to all the elders of Israel.\n",
      "Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tents,\n",
      "when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.\n",
      "Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and the foreigners who are within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;\n",
      "and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, your days approach that you must die. Call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him.” Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.\n",
      "Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the Tent’s door.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers. This people will rise up, and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.\n",
      "Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t these evils come on us because our God is not among us?’\n",
      "I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods.\n",
      "“Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.\n",
      "For when I have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.\n",
      "It will happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths of their descendants; for I know their ways and what they are doing this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.”\n",
      "So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.\n",
      "He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them. I will be with you.”\n",
      "When Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,\n",
      "Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, saying,\n",
      "“Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.\n",
      "For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. How much more after my death?\n",
      "Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.\n",
      "For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.”\n",
      "Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.\n",
      "Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak. Let the earth hear the words of my mouth.\n",
      "My doctrine will drop as the rain. My speech will condense as the dew, as the misty rain on the tender grass, as the showers on the herb.\n",
      "For I will proclaim Yahweh’s name. Ascribe greatness to our God!\n",
      "The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are just. A God of faithfulness who does no wrong, just and right is he.\n",
      "They have dealt corruptly with him. They are not his children, because of their defect. They are a perverse and crooked generation.\n",
      "Is this the way you repay Yahweh, foolish and unwise people? Isn’t he your father who has bought you? He has made you and established you.\n",
      "Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.\n",
      "When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.\n",
      "For Yahweh’s portion is his people. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.\n",
      "He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness. He surrounded him. He cared for him. He kept him as the apple of his eye.\n",
      "As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young, he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them on his feathers.\n",
      "Yahweh alone led him. There was no foreign god with him.\n",
      "He made him ride on the high places of the earth. He ate the increase of the field. He caused him to suck honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;\n",
      "butter from the herd, and milk from the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat. From the blood of the grape, you drank wine.\n",
      "But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You have grown fat. You have grown thick. You have become sleek. Then he abandoned God who made him, and rejected the Rock of his salvation.\n",
      "They moved him to jealousy with strange gods. They provoked him to anger with abominations.\n",
      "They sacrificed to demons, not God, to gods that they didn’t know, to new gods that came up recently, which your fathers didn’t dread.\n",
      "Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful, and have forgotten God who gave you birth.\n",
      "Yahweh saw and abhorred, because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.\n",
      "He said, “I will hide my face from them. I will see what their end will be; for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.\n",
      "They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities. I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.\n",
      "For a fire is kindled in my anger, that burns to the lowest Sheol, devours the earth with its increase, and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.\n",
      "“I will heap evils on them. I will spend my arrows on them.\n",
      "They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction. I will send the teeth of animals on them, with the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.\n",
      "Outside the sword will bereave, and in the rooms, terror; on both young man and virgin, the nursing infant with the gray-haired man.\n",
      "I said that I would scatter them afar. I would make their memory to cease from among men;\n",
      "were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say, ‘Our hand is exalted, Yahweh has not done all this.’”\n",
      "For they are a nation void of counsel. There is no understanding in them.\n",
      "Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!\n",
      "How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Yahweh had delivered them up?\n",
      "For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves concede.\n",
      "For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are poison grapes. Their clusters are bitter.\n",
      "Their wine is the poison of serpents, the cruel venom of asps.\n",
      "“Isn’t this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?\n",
      "Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand. Their doom rushes at them.”\n",
      "For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone; that there is no one remaining, shut up or left at large.\n",
      "He will say, “Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge;\n",
      "which ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you! Let them be your protection.\n",
      "“See now that I myself am he. There is no god with me. I kill and I make alive. I wound and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.\n",
      "For I lift up my hand to heaven and declare, as I live forever,\n",
      "if I sharpen my glittering sword, my hand grasps it in judgment; I will take vengeance on my adversaries, and will repay those who hate me.\n",
      "I will make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the head of the leaders of the enemy.”\n",
      "Rejoice, you nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will take vengeance on his adversaries, and will make atonement for his land and for his people.\n",
      "Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.\n",
      "Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel.\n",
      "He said to them, “Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.\n",
      "For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,\n",
      "“Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession.\n",
      "Die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people;\n",
      "because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn’t uphold my holiness among the children of Israel.\n",
      "For you shall see the land from a distance; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel.”\n",
      "This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.\n",
      "He said, “Yahweh came from Sinai, and rose from Seir to them. He shone from Mount Paran. He came from the ten thousands of holy ones. At his right hand was a fiery law for them.\n",
      "Yes, he loves the people. All his saints are in your hand. They sat down at your feet. Each receives your words.\n",
      "Moses commanded us a law, an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.\n",
      "He was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together.\n",
      "“Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.”\n",
      "This is for Judah. He said, “Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah. Bring him in to his people. With his hands he contended for himself. You shall be a help against his adversaries.”\n",
      "About Levi he said, “Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah.\n",
      "He said of his father, and of his mother, ‘I have not seen him.’ He didn’t acknowledge his brothers, nor did he know his own children; for they have observed your word, and keep your covenant.\n",
      "They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law. They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering on your altar.\n",
      "Yahweh, bless his skills. Accept the work of his hands. Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him, of those who hate him, that they not rise again.”\n",
      "About Benjamin he said, “The beloved of Yahweh will dwell in safety by him. He covers him all day long. He dwells between his shoulders.”\n",
      "About Joseph he said, “His land is blessed by Yahweh, for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep that couches beneath,\n",
      "for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious things that the moon can yield,\n",
      "for the best things of the ancient mountains, for the precious things of the everlasting hills,\n",
      "for the precious things of the earth and its fullness, the good will of him who lived in the bush. Let this come on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.\n",
      "The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his. His horns are the horns of the wild ox. With them he will push all the peoples, to the ends of the earth. They are the ten thousands of Ephraim. They are the thousands of Manasseh.”\n",
      "About Zebulun he said, “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and Issachar, in your tents.\n",
      "They will call the peoples to the mountain. There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they will draw out the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand.”\n",
      "About Gad he said, “He who enlarges Gad is blessed. He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head.\n",
      "He provided the first part for himself, for the lawgiver’s portion reserved was reserved for him. He came with the heads of the people. He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, His ordinances with Israel.”\n",
      "About Dan he said, “Dan is a lion’s cub that leaps out of Bashan.”\n",
      "About Naphtali he said, “Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of Yahweh’s blessing, Possess the west and the south.”\n",
      "About Asher he said, “Asher is blessed with children. Let him be acceptable to his brothers. Let him dip his foot in oil.\n",
      "Your bars will be iron and brass. As your days, so your strength will be.\n",
      "“There is no one like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens for your help, in his excellency on the skies.\n",
      "The eternal God is your dwelling place. Underneath are the everlasting arms. He thrust out the enemy from before you, and said, ‘Destroy!’\n",
      "Israel dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine. Yes, his heavens drop down dew.\n",
      "You are happy, Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh, the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency? Your enemies will submit themselves to you. You will tread on their high places.”\n",
      "Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,\n",
      "and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the western sea,\n",
      "and the south, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar.\n",
      "Yahweh said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.”\n",
      "So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to Yahweh’s word.\n",
      "He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor, but no man knows where his tomb is to this day.\n",
      "Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his strength gone.\n",
      "The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended.\n",
      "Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him. The children of Israel listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.\n",
      "Since then, there has not arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face,\n",
      "in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,\n",
      "and in all the mighty hand, and in all the awesome deeds, which Moses did in the sight of all Israel.\n",
      "Now after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh, Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ servant, saying,\n",
      "“Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go across this Jordan, you, and all these people, to the land which I am giving to them, even to the children of Israel.\n",
      "I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses.\n",
      "From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.\n",
      "No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.\n",
      "“Be strong and courageous; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.\n",
      "Only be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you. Don’t turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.\n",
      "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.\n",
      "Haven’t I commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be dismayed, for Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go.”\n",
      "Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,\n",
      "“Pass through the middle of the camp, and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.’”\n",
      "Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,\n",
      "“Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your God gives you rest, and will give you this land.\n",
      "Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock, shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them\n",
      "until Yahweh has given your brothers rest, as he has given you, and they have also possessed the land which Yahweh your God gives them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.’”\n",
      "They answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.\n",
      "Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.\n",
      "Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn’t listen to your words in all that you command him shall himself be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”\n",
      "Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, including Jericho.” They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and slept there.\n",
      "The king of Jericho was told, “Behold, men of the children of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land.”\n",
      "Jericho’s king sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered into your house; for they have come to spy out all the land.”\n",
      "The woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I didn’t know where they came from.\n",
      "About the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, the men went out. Where the men went, I don’t know. Pursue them quickly. You may catch up with them.”\n",
      "But she had brought them up to the roof, and hidden them under the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof.\n",
      "The men pursued them along the way to the fords of the Jordan River. As soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.\n",
      "Before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof.\n",
      "She said to the men, “I know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.\n",
      "For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.\n",
      "As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, and there wasn’t any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.\n",
      "Now therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true sign;\n",
      "and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.”\n",
      "The men said to her, “Our life for yours, if you don’t talk about this business of ours; and it shall be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.”\n",
      "Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on the wall.\n",
      "She said to them, “Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you. Hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your way.”\n",
      "The men said to her, “We will be guiltless of this your oath which you’ve made us to swear.\n",
      "Behold, when we come into the land, tie this line of scarlet thread in the window which you used to let us down. Gather to yourself into the house your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household.\n",
      "It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him.\n",
      "But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you’ve made us to swear.”\n",
      "She said, “Let it be as you have said.” She sent them away, and they departed. Then she tied the scarlet line in the window.\n",
      "They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them all along the way, but didn’t find them.\n",
      "Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain, crossed the river, and came to Joshua the son of Nun. They told him all that had happened to them.\n",
      "They said to Joshua, “Truly Yahweh has delivered all the land into our hands. Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.”\n",
      "Joshua got up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel. They camped there before they crossed over.\n",
      "After three days, the officers went through the middle of the camp;\n",
      "and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall leave your place, and follow it.\n",
      "Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Don’t come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed this way before.”\n",
      "Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders among you.”\n",
      "Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and cross over before the people.” They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.\n",
      "You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’”\n",
      "Joshua said to the children of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your God.”\n",
      "Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite out from before you.\n",
      "Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.\n",
      "Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.\n",
      "It shall be that when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan will be cut off. The waters that come down from above shall stand in one heap.”\n",
      "When the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people,\n",
      "and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),\n",
      "the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people passed over near Jericho.\n",
      "The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the nation had passed completely over the Jordan.\n",
      "When all the nation had completely crossed over the Jordan, Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,\n",
      "“Take twelve men out of the people, a man out of every tribe,\n",
      "and command them, saying, ‘Take from out of the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the place where you’ll camp tonight.’”\n",
      "Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, a man out of every tribe.\n",
      "Joshua said to them, “Cross before the ark of Yahweh your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;\n",
      "that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in the future, saying, ‘What do you mean by these stones?’\n",
      "then you shall tell them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. When it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.’”\n",
      "The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel. They carried them over with them to the place where they camped, and laid them down there.\n",
      "Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.\n",
      "For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and passed over.\n",
      "When all the people had completely crossed over, Yahweh’s ark crossed over, with the priests, in the presence of the people.\n",
      "The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.\n",
      "About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.\n",
      "On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,\n",
      "“Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.”\n",
      "Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, “Come up out of the Jordan!”\n",
      "When the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet had been lifted up to the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks, as before.\n",
      "The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.\n",
      "Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal.\n",
      "He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’\n",
      "Then you shall let your children know, saying, ‘Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.\n",
      "For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until you had crossed over, as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had crossed over;\n",
      "that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Yahweh is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.’”\n",
      "When all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we had crossed over, their heart melted, and there was no more spirit in them, because of the children of Israel.\n",
      "At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make flint knives, and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.”\n",
      "Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.\n",
      "This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way, after they came out of Egypt.\n",
      "For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.\n",
      "For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they didn’t listen to the voice of Yahweh. Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn’t let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.\n",
      "Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.\n",
      "When they were done circumcising the whole nation, they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt off of you.” Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.\n",
      "The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.\n",
      "They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.\n",
      "The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel didn’t have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.\n",
      "When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our enemies?”\n",
      "He said, “No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh’s army.” Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and asked him, “What does my lord say to his servant?”\n",
      "The prince of Yahweh’s army said to Joshua, “Take your shoes off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy.” Joshua did so.\n",
      "Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the mighty men of valor.\n",
      "All of your men of war shall march around the city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days.\n",
      "Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.\n",
      "It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up, every man straight in front of him.”\n",
      "Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Yahweh’s ark.”\n",
      "They said to the people, “Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh’s ark.”\n",
      "It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Yahweh advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.\n",
      "The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets sounded as they went.\n",
      "Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.”\n",
      "So he caused Yahweh’s ark to go around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and stayed in the camp.\n",
      "Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up Yahweh’s ark.\n",
      "The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of Yahweh’s ark went on continually, and blew the trumpets. The armed men went in front of them. The rear guard came after Yahweh’s ark. The trumpets sounded as they went.\n",
      "The second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days.\n",
      "On the seventh day, they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.\n",
      "At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for Yahweh has given you the city!\n",
      "The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh. Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.\n",
      "But as for you, only keep yourselves from what is devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so you would make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.\n",
      "But all the silver, gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to Yahweh. They shall come into Yahweh’s treasury.”\n",
      "So the people shouted and the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight in front of him, and they took the city.\n",
      "They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house, and bring the woman and all that she has out from there, as you swore to her.”\n",
      "The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all of her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Israel.\n",
      "They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "But Rahab the prostitute, her father’s household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lives in the middle of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.\n",
      "Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed is the man before Yahweh, who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he will set up its gates.”\n",
      "So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.\n",
      "But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against the children of Israel.\n",
      "Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.” The men went up and spied out Ai.\n",
      "They returned to Joshua, and said to him, “Don’t let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Don’t make all the people to toil there, for there are only a few of them.”\n",
      "So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.\n",
      "The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of them, and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became like water.\n",
      "Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before Yahweh’s ark until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.\n",
      "Joshua said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan!\n",
      "Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!\n",
      "For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Get up! Why have you fallen on your face like that?\n",
      "Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken some of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it among their own stuff.\n",
      "Therefore the children of Israel can’t stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.\n",
      "“Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, “There is a devoted among you, Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you.”\n",
      "“‘In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. It shall be that the tribe which Yahweh selects shall come near by families. The family which Yahweh selects shall come near by households. The household which Yahweh selects shall come near man by man.\n",
      "It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.’”\n",
      "So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes. The tribe of Judah was selected.\n",
      "He brought near the family of Judah; and he selected the family of the Zerahites. He brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was selected.\n",
      "He brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.\n",
      "Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to him. Tell me now what you have done! Don’t hide it from me!”\n",
      "Achan answered Joshua, and said, “I have truly sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and this is what I have done.\n",
      "When I saw among the plunder a beautiful Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. Behold, they are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver under it.”\n",
      "So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.\n",
      "They took them from the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel. They laid them down before Yahweh.\n",
      "Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.\n",
      "Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you this day.” All Israel stoned him with stones, and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.\n",
      "They raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called “The valley of Achor” to this day.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Don’t be afraid, and don’t be dismayed. Take all the warriors with you, and arise, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, with his people, his city, and his land.\n",
      "You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king, except you shall take its goods and its livestock for for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it.”\n",
      "So Joshua arose, with all the warriors, to go up to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them out by night.\n",
      "He commanded them, saying, “Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Don’t go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.\n",
      "I and all the people who are with me will approach to the city. It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.\n",
      "They will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, ‘They flee before us, like the first time.’ So we will flee before them,\n",
      "and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.\n",
      "It shall be, when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do this according to Yahweh’s word. Behold, I have commanded you.”\n",
      "Joshua sent them out; and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua stayed among the people that night.\n",
      "Joshua rose up early in the morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.\n",
      "All the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.\n",
      "He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.\n",
      "So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the middle of the valley.\n",
      "When the king of Ai saw it, they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he didn’t know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.\n",
      "Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.\n",
      "All the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them. They pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.\n",
      "There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El who didn’t go out after Israel. They left the city open, and pursued Israel.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.” Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.\n",
      "The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire.\n",
      "When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. The people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.\n",
      "When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai.\n",
      "The others came out of the city against them, so they were in the middle of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. They struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.\n",
      "They captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.\n",
      "When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, all Israel returned to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.\n",
      "For Joshua didn’t draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.\n",
      "Israel took for themselves only the livestock and the goods of that city, according to Yahweh’s word which he commanded Joshua.\n",
      "So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.\n",
      "He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the evening, and at sundown Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a great heap of stones on it that remains to this day.\n",
      "Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,\n",
      "as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, on which no one had lifted up any iron. They offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh and sacrificed peace offerings.\n",
      "He wrote there on the stones a copy of Moses’ law, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.\n",
      "All Israel, their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on both sides of the ark before the priests the Levites, who carried the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, the foreigner as well as the native; half of them in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.\n",
      "Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.\n",
      "There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua didn’t read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.\n",
      "When all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it\n",
      "they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.\n",
      "But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,\n",
      "they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys, and old, torn-up and bound up wine skins,\n",
      "and old and patched shoes on their feet, and wore old garments. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.\n",
      "They went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country. Now therefore make a covenant with us.”\n",
      "The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “What if you live among us. How could we make a covenant with you?”\n",
      "They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” Joshua said to them, “Who are you? Where do you come from?”\n",
      "They said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God; for we have heard of his fame, all that he did in Egypt,\n",
      "and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.\n",
      "Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take supplies in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them. Tell them, “We are your servants. Now make a covenant with us.”’\n",
      "This our bread we took hot for our supplies out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy.\n",
      "These wine skins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey.”\n",
      "The men sampled their provisions, and didn’t ask counsel from Yahweh’s mouth.\n",
      "Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation swore to them.\n",
      "At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they lived among them.\n",
      "The children of Israel traveled and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.\n",
      "The children of Israel didn’t strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. All the congregation murmured against the princes.\n",
      "But all the princes said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. Now therefore we may not touch them.\n",
      "We will do this to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them.”\n",
      "The princes said to them, “Let them live, so they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them.”\n",
      "Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you, ’ when you live among us?\n",
      "Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be slaves, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.”\n",
      "They answered Joshua, and said, “Because your servants were certainly told how Yahweh your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.\n",
      "Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do.”\n",
      "He did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they didn’t kill them.\n",
      "That day Joshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh to this day, in the place which he should choose.\n",
      "Now when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai. and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them.\n",
      "They were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.\n",
      "Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying,\n",
      "“Come up to me and help me. Let us strike Gibeon; for they have made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.”\n",
      "Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.\n",
      "The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Don’t abandon your servants! Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us.”\n",
      "So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and the whole army with him, including all the mighty men of valor.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Don’t fear them, for I have delivered them into your hands. Not a man of them will stand before you.”\n",
      "Joshua therefore came to them suddenly. He marched from Gilgal all night.\n",
      "Yahweh confused them before Israel. He killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah.\n",
      "As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, Yahweh hurled down great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the children of Israel killed with the sword.\n",
      "Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel. He said in the sight of Israel, “Sun, stand still on Gibeon! You, moon, stop in the valley of Aijalon!”\n",
      "The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn’t this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the middle of the sky, and didn’t hurry to go down about a whole day.\n",
      "There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel.\n",
      "Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.\n",
      "These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.\n",
      "Joshua was told, saying, “The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”\n",
      "Joshua said, “Roll large stones to cover the cave’s entrance, and set men by it to guard them;\n",
      "but don’t stay there. Pursue your enemies, and attack them from the rear. Don’t allow them to enter into their cities; for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand.”\n",
      "When Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,\n",
      "all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.\n",
      "Then Joshua said, “Open the cave entrance, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me.”\n",
      "They did so, and brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.\n",
      "When they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, “Come near. Put your feet on the necks of these kings.” They came near, and put their feet on their necks.\n",
      "Joshua said to them, “Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and courageous, for Yahweh will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight.”\n",
      "Afterward Joshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging on the trees until the evening.\n",
      "At the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and threw them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.\n",
      "Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He utterly destroyed it and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining. He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.\n",
      "Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.\n",
      "Yahweh delivered it also, with its king, into the hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining in it. He did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.\n",
      "Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.\n",
      "Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel. He took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with all the souls who were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.\n",
      "Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him no one remaining.\n",
      "Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it fought against it.\n",
      "They took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.\n",
      "Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.\n",
      "They took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king and all its cities, and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were in it.\n",
      "Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it.\n",
      "He took it, with its king and all its cities. They struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining. As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.\n",
      "So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, the South, the lowland, the slopes, and all their kings. He left no one remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.\n",
      "Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.\n",
      "Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.\n",
      "Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.\n",
      "When Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,\n",
      "and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,\n",
      "to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.\n",
      "They went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.\n",
      "All these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Don’t be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will deliver them up all slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”\n",
      "So Joshua came suddenly, with all the warriors, against them by the waters of Merom, and attacked them.\n",
      "Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them, and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim, and to the valley of Mizpah eastward. They struck them until they left them no one remaining.\n",
      "Joshua did to them as Yahweh told him. He hamstrung their horses and burnt their chariots with fire.\n",
      "Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms.\n",
      "They struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left who breathed. He burnt Hazor with fire.\n",
      "Joshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded.\n",
      "But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only. Joshua burned that.\n",
      "The children of Israel took all the plunder of these cities, with the livestock, as plunder for themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They didn’t leave any who breathed.\n",
      "As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua. Joshua did so. He left nothing undone of all that Yahweh commanded Moses.\n",
      "So Joshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;\n",
      "from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.\n",
      "Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.\n",
      "There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all in battle.\n",
      "For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.\n",
      "Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.\n",
      "There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.\n",
      "So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. The land had rest from war.\n",
      "Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:\n",
      "Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;\n",
      "and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:\n",
      "and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,\n",
      "and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.\n",
      "Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them. Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.\n",
      "These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir. Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;\n",
      "in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:\n",
      "the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;\n",

      "Now Joshua was old and well advanced in years. Yahweh said to him, “You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.\n",
      "“This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;\n",
      "from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border of Ekron northward, which is counted as Canaanite; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,\n",

      "With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them:\n",

      "by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.\n",
      "For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.\n",
      "For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. They gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their livestock and for their property.\n",
      "The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses, and they divided the land.\n",
      "Then the children of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal. Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.\n",
      "I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land. I brought him word again as it was in my heart.\n",

      "Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and great and fortified cities. It may be that Yahweh will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh said.”\n",
      "Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.\n",
      "Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he followed Yahweh, the God of Israel wholeheartedly.\n",

      "Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities with their villages.\n",
      "As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah couldn’t drive them out; but the Jebusites live with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.\n",
      "The lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel.\n",
      "It went out from Bethel to Luz, and passed along to the border of the Archites to Ataroth;\n",
      "and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, to the border of Beth Horon the lower, and on to Gezer; and ended at the sea.\n",
      "The children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.\n",
      "This was the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families. The border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Horon the upper.\n",
      "The border went out westward at Michmethath on the north. The border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah.\n",
      "It went down from Janoah to Ataroth, to Naarah, reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.\n",
      "From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families;\n",
      "together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the middle of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.\n",
      "They didn’t drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell in the territory of Ephraim to this day, and have become servants to do forced labor.\n",
      "This was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.\n",
      "So this was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, for the children of Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the children of Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida. These were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.\n",
      "But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.\n",
      "They came to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the princes, saying, “Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” Therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.\n",
      "Ten parts fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;\n",
      "because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.\n",
      "The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem. The border went along to the right hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.\n",
      "The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.\n",
      "The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook. These cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and ended at the sea.\n",
      "Southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border. They reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.\n",
      "Manasseh had three heights in Issachar, in Asher Beth Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns.\n",
      "Yet the children of Manasseh couldn’t drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.\n",
      "When the children of Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn’t utterly drive them out.\n",
      "The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance, since we are a numerous people, because Yahweh has blessed us so far?”\n",
      "Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest, and clear land for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.”\n",
      "The children of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us. All the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.”\n",
      "Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, that is, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, “You are a numerous people, and have great power. You shall not have one lot only;\n",
      "but the hill country shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it’s farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.”\n",
      "The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The land was subdued before them.\n",
      "Seven tribes remained among the children of Israel, which had not yet divided their inheritance.\n",
      "Joshua said to the children of Israel, “How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you?\n",
      "Appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe. I will send them, and they shall arise, walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come to me.\n",
      "They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall live in his borders on the south, and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north.\n",
      "You shall survey the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God.\n",
      "However, the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance east of the Jordan, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them.”\n",
      "The men arose and went. Joshua commanded those who went to survey the land, saying, “Go walk through the land, survey it, and come again to me. I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.”\n",
      "The men went and passed through the land, and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book. They came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.\n",
      "Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh. There Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.\n",
      "The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families. The border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.\n",
      "Their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan. The border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward. It ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven.\n",
      "The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz (also called Bethel), southward. The border went down to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Horon the lower.\n",
      "The border extended, and turned around on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward; and ended at Kiriath Baal (also called Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah. This was the west quarter.\n",
      "The south quarter was from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim. The border went out westward, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.\n",
      "The border went down to the farthest part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward. It went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En Rogel.\n",
      "It extended northward, went out at En Shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim. It went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.\n",
      "It passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah.\n",

      "Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,\n",
      "that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh? It will be, since you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.\n",
      "However, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh, in which Yahweh’s tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us; but don’t rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us, in building an altar other than the altar of Yahweh our God.\n",

      "that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh; or if to offer burnt offering or meal offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings, let Yahweh himself require it.\n",
      "“If we have not out of concern done this, and for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, “What have you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?\n",
      "For Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad. You have no portion in Yahweh.”’ So your children might make our children cease from fearing Yahweh.\n",

      "“Therefore we said, ‘It shall be, when they tell us or our generations this in time to come, that we shall say, “Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you.”’\n",
      "“Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle!”\n",
      "When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.\n",
      "Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is among us, because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh. Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh.”\n",
      "Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.\n",
      "The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad lived.\n",
      "The children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar “A Witness Between Us that Yahweh is God.”\n",
      "After many days, when Yahweh had given rest to Israel from their enemies all around, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years,\n",
      "Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said to them, “I am old and well advanced in years.\n",

      "“Behold, today I am going the way of all the earth. You know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which Yahweh your God spoke concerning you. All have happened to you. Not one thing has failed of it.\n",

      "Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.\n",

      "“‘I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand. You possessed their land, and I destroyed them from before you.\n",
      "Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you,\n",
      "but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still. So I delivered you out of his hand.\n",
      "“‘You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.\n",
      "I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword, nor with your bow.\n",
      "I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities which you didn’t build, and you live in them. You eat of vineyards and olive groves which you didn’t plant.’\n",
      "“Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth. Put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, in Egypt; and serve Yahweh.\n",
      "If it seems evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh.”\n",
      "The people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;\n",

      "Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve Yahweh; for he is our God.”\n",
      "Joshua said to the people, “You can’t serve Yahweh, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins.\n",

      "But Adoni-Bezek fled. They pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.\n",
      "Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their big toes cut off, scavenged under my table. As I have done, so God has done to me.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.\n",

      "After that, the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.\n",
      "Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron. (The name of Hebron before that was Kiriath Arba.) They struck Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.\n",
      "From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir before that was Kiriath Sepher.)\n",

      "She said to him, “Give me a blessing; because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.” Then Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.\n",
      "The children of the Kenite, Moses’ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.\n",
      "Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah.\n",
      "Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.\n",
      "Yahweh was with Judah; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.\n",
      "They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove the three sons of Anak out of there.\n",
      "The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.\n",

      "The man went into the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.\n",
      "Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.\n",
      "When Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and did not utterly drive them out.\n",

      "Yahweh’s angel came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, “I brought you out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to give your fathers. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you.\n",
      "You shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You shall break down their altars.’ But you have not listened to my voice. Why have you done this?\n",
      "Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’”\n",
      "When Yahweh’s angel spoke these words to all the children of Israel, the people lifted up their voice, and wept.\n",
      "They called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there to Yahweh.\n",
      "Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel each went to his inheritance to possess the land.\n",
      "The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel.\n",
      "Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.\n",

      "After all that generation were gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them, who didn’t know Yahweh, nor the work which he had done for Israel.\n",
      "The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served the Baals.\n",
      "They abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; and they provoked Yahweh to anger.\n",
      "They abandoned Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.\n",
      "Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.\n",
      "Wherever they went out, Yahweh’s hand was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them; and they were very distressed.\n",
      "Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them.\n",
      "Yet they didn’t listen to their judges; for they prostituted themselves to other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked, obeying Yahweh’s commandments. They didn’t do so.\n",
      "When Yahweh raised up judges for them, then Yahweh was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them.\n",
      "But when the judge was dead, they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them. They didn’t cease what they were doing, nor their stubborn ways.\n",
      "Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel; and he said, “Because this nation transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and did not listened to my voice,\n",
      "I also will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died from before them;\n",
      "that by them I may test Israel, to see if they will keep the Yahweh’s way to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not.”\n",
      "So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily. He didn’t deliver them into Joshua’s hand.\n",
      "Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to test Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan;\n",
      "only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least those who knew nothing of it before:\n",
      "the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.\n",
      "They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to Yahweh’s commandments, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.\n",
      "The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.\n",
      "They took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.\n",
      "The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.\n",
      "When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.\n",
      "The Yahweh’s Spirit came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. His hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.\n",
      "The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.\n",
      "The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.\n",
      "He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.\n",
      "The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.\n",
      "But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior for them, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.\n",
      "Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.\n",
      "He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.\n",
      "When he had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.\n",
      "But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” The king said, “Keep silence!” All who stood by him left him.\n",
      "Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, “I have a message from God to you.” He arose out of his seat.\n",
      "Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:\n",
      "and the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.\n",
      "Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.\n",
      "After he had gone, his servants came and saw that the doors of the upper room were locked. They said, “Surely he is covering his feet in the upper room.”\n",
      "They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn’t open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor.\n",
      "Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.\n",
      "When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them.\n",
      "He said to them, “Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn’t allow any man to pass over.\n",
      "They struck at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man, and every man of valor. No man escaped.\n",
      "So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had rest eighty years.\n",
      "After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved Israel.\n",
      "The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.\n",
      "Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.\n",
      "The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years.\n",
      "Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time.\n",
      "She lived under Deborah’s palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.\n",
      "She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, “Hasn’t Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, ‘Go and lead the way to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?\n",
      "I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.’”\n",
      "Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”\n",
      "She said, “I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the journey that you take won’t be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into a woman’s hand.” Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.\n",
      "Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him.\n",
      "Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.\n",
      "They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.\n",
      "Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.\n",
      "Deborah said to Barak, “Go; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn’t Yahweh gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.\n",
      "Yahweh confused Sisera, all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled away on his feet.\n",
      "But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left.\n",
      "However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.\n",
      "Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.\n",
      "He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.” She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him.\n",
      "He said to her, “Stand in the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’”\n",
      "Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and died.\n",
      "Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.\n",
      "So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day.\n",
      "The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.\n",
      "Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,\n",
      "“Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, because the people offered themselves willingly, be blessed, Yahweh!\n",
      "“Hear, you kings! Give ear, you princes! I, even I, will sing to Yahweh. I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "“Yahweh, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the sky also dropped. Yes, the clouds dropped water.\n",
      "The mountains quaked Yahweh’s presence, even Sinai at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "“In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied. The travelers walked through byways.\n",
      "The rulers ceased in Israel. They ceased until I, Deborah, arose; Until I arose a mother in Israel.\n",
      "They chose new gods. Then war was in the gates. Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?\n",
      "My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless Yahweh!\n",
      "“Speak, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets, and you who walk by the way.\n",
      "Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there they will rehearse Yahweh’s righteous acts, the righteous acts of his rule in Israel. “Then Yahweh’s people went down to the gates.\n",
      "‘Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.’\n",
      "“Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down. Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.\n",
      "Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim, after you, Benjamin, among your peoples. Governors come down out of Machir. Those who handle the marshal’s staff came out of Zebulun.\n",
      "The princes of Issachar were with Deborah. As was Issachar, so was Barak. They rushed into the valley at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben, there were great resolves of heart.\n",
      "Why did you sit among the sheepfolds? To hear the whistling for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben, there were great searchings of heart.\n",
      "Gilead lived beyond the Jordan. Why did Dan remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and lived by his creeks.\n",
      "Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the death; Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.\n",
      "“The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo. They took no plunder of silver.\n",
      "From the sky the stars fought. From their courses, they fought against Sisera.\n",
      "The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. My soul, march on with strength.\n",
      "Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancing, the prancing of their strong ones.\n",
      "‘Curse Meroz, ’ said Yahweh’s angel. ‘Curse bitterly its inhabitants, because they didn’t come to help Yahweh, to help Yahweh against the mighty.’\n",
      "“Jael shall be blessed above women, the wife of Heber the Kenite; blessed shall she be above women in the tent.\n",
      "He asked for water. She gave him milk. She brought him butter in a lordly dish.\n",
      "She put her hand to the tent peg, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer. With the hammer she struck Sisera. She struck through his head. Yes, she pierced and struck through his temples.\n",
      "At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay. At her feet he bowed, he fell. Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.\n",
      "“Through the window she looked out, and cried: Sisera’s mother looked through the lattice. ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?’\n",
      "Her wise ladies answered her, Yes, she returned answer to herself,\n",
      "‘Have they not found, have they not divided the plunder? A lady, two ladies to every man; to Sisera a plunder of dyed garments, a plunder of dyed garments embroidered, of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the plunder?’\n",
      "“So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh, but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises in its strength.” Then the land had rest forty years.\n",
      "The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.\n",
      "The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made themselves the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.\n",
      "So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the children of the east came up against them.\n",
      "They encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, until you come to Gaza. They left no sustenance in Israel, and no sheep, ox, or donkey.\n",
      "For they came up with their livestock and their tents. They came in as locusts for multitude. Both they and their camels were without number; and they came into the land to destroy it.\n",
      "Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to Yahweh.\n",
      "When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian,\n",
      "Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel; and he said to them, “Yahweh says, the God of Israel, ‘I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage.\n",
      "I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land.\n",
      "I said to you, “I am Yahweh your God. You shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.” But you have not listened to my voice.’”\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel appeared to him, and said to him, “Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor!”\n",
      "Gideon said to him, “Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, ‘Didn’t Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?’ But now Yahweh has cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.”\n",
      "Yahweh looked at him, and said, “Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Haven’t I sent you?”\n",
      "He said to him, “O Lord, how shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to him, “Surely I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.”\n",
      "He said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.\n",
      "Please don’t go away, until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before you.” He said, “I will wait until you come back.”\n",
      "Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal. He put the meat in a basket and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.\n",
      "The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” He did so.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s angel stretched out the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and fire went up out of the rock, and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. Then Yahweh’s angel departed out of his sight.\n",
      "Gideon saw that he was Yahweh’s angel; and Gideon said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh! Because I have seen Yahweh’s angel face to face!”\n",
      "Yahweh said to him, “Peace be to you! Don’t be afraid. You shall not die.”\n",
      "Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh, and called it “Yahweh is Peace.” To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n",
      "That same night, Yahweh said to him, “Take your father’s bull, even the second bull seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it.\n",
      "Then build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold, in an orderly way, and take the second bull, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.”\n",
      "Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Yahweh had spoken to him. Because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, he could not do it by day, but he did it by night.\n",
      "When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built.\n",
      "They said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” When they inquired and asked, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.”\n",
      "Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.”\n",
      "Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? He who will contend for him, let him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has broken down his altar!”\n",
      "Therefore on that day he named him Jerub-Baal, saying, “Let Baal contend against him, because he has broken down his altar.”\n",
      "Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.\n",
      "But Yahweh’s Spirit came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together to follow him.\n",
      "He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together to follow him. He sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.\n",
      "Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,\n",
      "behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken.”\n",
      "It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.\n",
      "Gideon said to God, “Don’t let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.”\n",
      "God did so that night; for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.\n",
      "Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod. Midian’s camp was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel brag against me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’\n",
      "Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Gideon, “There are still too many people. Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. It shall be, that those whom I tell you, ‘This shall go with you, ’ the same shall go with you; and whoever I tell you, ‘This shall not go with you, ’ the same shall not go.”\n",
      "So he brought down the people to the water; and Yahweh said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.”\n",
      "The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Gideon, “By the three hundred men who lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, each to his own place.”\n",
      "So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.\n",
      "That same night, Yahweh said to him, “Arise, go down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.\n",
      "But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp.\n",
      "You will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp.” Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.\n",
      "The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude.\n",
      "When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow. He said, “Behold, I dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.”\n",
      "His fellow answered, “This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has delivered Midian into his hand, with all the army.”\n",
      "It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped. Then he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, “Arise; for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian into your hand!”\n",
      "He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.\n",
      "He said to them, “Watch me, and do likewise. Behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so you shall do.\n",
      "When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, ‘For Yahweh and for Gideon!’”\n",
      "So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch. Then they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.\n",
      "The three companies blew the trumpets, broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they shouted, “The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon!”\n",
      "They each stood in his place around the camp; and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight.\n",
      "They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every man’s sword against his fellow, and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.\n",
      "The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued Midian.\n",
      "Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan!” So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.\n",
      "They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at Oreb’s rock, and Zeeb they killed at Zeeb’s wine press; and pursued Midian. Then they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.\n",
      "The men of Ephraim said to him, “Why have you treated us this way, that you didn’t call us when you went to fight with Midian?” They rebuked him sharply.\n",
      "He said to them, “What have I now done in comparison with you? Isn’t the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?\n",
      "God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb! What was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.\n",
      "Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.\n",
      "He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”\n",
      "The princes of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?”\n",
      "Gideon said, “Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.”\n",
      "He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.\n",
      "He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.”\n",
      "Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword.\n",
      "Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army; for the army was secure.\n",
      "Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued them. He took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and confused all the army.\n",
      "Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.\n",
      "He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, seventy-seven men.\n",
      "He came to the men of Succoth, and said, “See Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?’”\n",
      "He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.\n",
      "He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.\n",
      "Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?” They answered, “They were like you. Each one resembled the children of a king.”\n",
      "He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.”\n",
      "He said to Jether his firstborn, “Get up, and kill them!” But the youth didn’t draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.\n",
      "Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’ necks.\n",
      "Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you, and your son, and your son’s son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.”\n",
      "Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. Yahweh shall rule over you.”\n",
      "Gideon said to them, “I do have a request, that you would each give me the earrings of his plunder.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)\n",
      "They answered, “We will willingly give them.” They spread a garment, and every man threw the earrings of his plunder into it.\n",
      "The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels’ necks.\n",
      "Gideon made an ephod out of it, and put it in Ophrah, his city. Then all Israel played the prostitute with it there; and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.\n",
      "So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. The land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.\n",
      "Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.\n",
      "Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body, for he had many wives.\n",
      "His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.\n",
      "Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n",
      "As soon as Gideon was dead, the children of Israel turned again, and played the prostitute following the Baals, and made Baal Berith their god.\n",
      "The children of Israel didn’t remember Yahweh their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;\n",
      "neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.\n",
      "Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s brothers, and spoke with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,\n",
      "“Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, ‘Is it better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.”\n",
      "His mother’s brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words. Their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, “He is our brother.”\n",
      "They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.\n",
      "He went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.\n",
      "All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.\n",
      "When they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said to them, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.\n",
      "The trees set out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’\n",
      "“But the olive tree said to them, ‘Should I leave my fatness, with which they honor God and man by me, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’\n",
      "“The trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and reign over us.’\n",
      "“But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’\n",
      "“The trees said to the vine, ‘Come and reign over us.’\n",
      "“The vine said to them, ‘Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’\n",
      "“Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘Come and reign over us.’\n",
      "“The bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’\n",
      "“Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands\n",
      "(for my father fought for you, and risked his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian;\n",
      "and you have risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);\n",
      "if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you;\n",
      "but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.”\n",
      "Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and lived there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.\n",
      "Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.\n",
      "Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,\n",
      "that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.\n",
      "The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them, and Abimelech was told about it.\n",
      "Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.\n",
      "They went out into the field, harvested their vineyards, trod the grapes, held festival, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.\n",
      "Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn’t he the son of Jerubbaal? Isn’t Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem, but why should we serve him?\n",
      "I wish that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech.” He said to Abimelech, “Increase your army, and come out!”\n",
      "When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.\n",
      "He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and behold, they incite the city against you.\n",
      "Now therefore, go up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field.\n",
      "It shall be that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and rush on the city. Behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.”\n",
      "Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.\n",
      "Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. Abimelech rose up, and the people who were with him, from the ambush.\n",
      "When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains.” Zebul said to him, “You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.”\n",
      "Gaal spoke again and said, “Behold, people are coming down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim.”\n",
      "Then Zebul said to him, “Now where is your mouth, that you said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you have despised? Please go out now and fight with them.”\n",
      "Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.\n",

      "He took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came out of the city. So, he rose up against them, and struck them.\n",
      "Abimelech and the companies that were with him rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field, and struck them.\n",
      "Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and killed the people in it. He beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.\n",
      "When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.\n",
      "Abimelech was told that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.\n",
      "Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done!”\n",
      "All the people likewise each cut down his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them at the base of the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.\n",
      "Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.\n",
      "But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women of the city fled there, and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower.\n",
      "Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.\n",
      "A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, and broke his skull.\n",
      "Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword, and kill me, that men not say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ His young man thrust him through, and he died.”\n",
      "When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they each departed to his place.\n",
      "Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;\n",
      "and God repaid all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads; and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came on them.\n",
      "After Abimelech, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.\n",
      "He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.\n",
      "After him Jair, the Gileadite arose, and he judged Israel twenty-two years.\n",
      "He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.\n",
      "Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.\n",
      "The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served the Baals, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned Yahweh, and didn’t serve him.\n",
      "Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "They troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year. For eighteen years, they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.\n",
      "The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was very distressed.\n",
      "The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, saying, “We have sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baals.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to the children of Israel, “Didn’t I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?\n",
      "The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.\n",
      "Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods. Therefore I will save you no more.\n",
      "Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress!”\n",
      "The children of Israel said to Yahweh, “We have sinned! Do you to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us, please, this day.”\n",
      "They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Yahweh; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.\n",
      "Then the children of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead. The children of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in Mizpah.\n",
      "The people, the princes of Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”\n",
      "Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a prostitute. Gilead became the father of Jephthah.\n",
      "Gilead’s wife bore him sons. When his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out, and said to him, “You will not inherit in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.”\n",
      "Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob. Outlaws joined up with Jephthah, and they went out with him.\n",
      "After a while, the children of Ammon made war against Israel.\n",
      "When the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob.\n",
      "They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.”\n",
      "Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?”\n",
      "The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon. You will be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”\n",
      "Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivers them before me, will I be your head?”\n",
      "The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Yahweh will be witness between us. Surely we will do what you say.”\n",
      "Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them. Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in Mizpah.\n",
      "Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, “What have you to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?”\n",
      "The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore restore that territory again peaceably.”\n",
      "Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;\n",
      "and he said to him, “Thus says Jephthah: Israel didn’t take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,\n",
      "but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;\n",
      "then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let me pass through your land; ’ but the king of Edom didn’t listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel stayed in Kadesh.\n",
      "Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn’t come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.\n",
      "Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, ‘Please let us pass through your land to my place.’\n",
      "But Sihon didn’t trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.\n",
      "They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.\n",
      "So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?\n",
      "Won’t you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.\n",
      "Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?\n",
      "While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn’t you recover them within that time?\n",
      "I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. May Yahweh the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.”\n",
      "However the king of the children of Ammon didn’t listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s Spirit came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.\n",
      "Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,\n",
      "then it shall be, that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.”\n",
      "So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.\n",
      "He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.\n",
      "Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. She was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter.\n",
      "When he saw her, he tore his clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Yahweh, and I can’t go back.”\n",
      "She said to him, “My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.”\n",
      "She said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me. Leave me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.”\n",
      "He said, “Go.” He sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her virginity on the mountains.\n",
      "At the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed. She was a virgin. It was a custom in Israel\n",
      "that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.\n",
      "The men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah, “Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didn’t call us to go with you? We will burn your house around you with fire!”\n",
      "Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn’t save me out of their hand.\n",
      "When I saw that you didn’t save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day, to fight against me?”\n",
      "Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim. The men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the middle of Ephraim, and in the middle of Manasseh.”\n",
      "The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. When the fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me go over, ” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No”;\n",
      "then they said to him, “Now say ‘Shibboleth; ’” and he said “Sibboleth”; for he couldn’t manage to pronounce it right: then they seized him, and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time, forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell.\n",
      "Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in the cities of Gilead.\n",
      "After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.\n"

      "but he said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and don’t eat any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.’”\n",
      "Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, “Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us, and teach us what we should do to the child who shall be born.”\n",
      "God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field, but Manoah, her husband, wasn’t with her.\n",

      "Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why do you ask about my name, since it is incomprehensible?”\n",
      "So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh. Then the angel did an amazing thing as Manoah and his wife watched.\n",

      "The woman bore a son, and named him Samson. The child grew, and Yahweh blessed him.\n",
      "Yahweh’s Spirit began to move him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.\n",
      "Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.\n",
      "He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore get her for me as my wife.”\n",

      "But his father and his mother didn’t know that it was of Yahweh; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines ruled over Israel.\n",

      "Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat; and he had nothing in his hand, but he didn’t tell his father or his mother what he had done.\n",
      "He went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.\n",
      "After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion; and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.\n",
      "He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went. He came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they ate, but he didn’t tell them that he had taken the honey out of the lion’s body.\n",
      "His father went down to the woman: and Samson made a feast there; for so the young men used to do.\n",
      "When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.\n",
      "Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle now. If you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;\n",

      "On the seventh day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Isn’t that so?”\n",
      "Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, “You just hate me, and don’t love me. You’ve told a riddle to the children of my people, and haven’t told it to me.” He said to her, “Behold, I haven’t told my father or my mother, so why should I tell you?”\n",
      "She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and on the seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.\n",
      "The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?” He said to them, “If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer, you wouldn’t have found out my riddle.”\n",
      "Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their plunder, then gave the changes of clothing to those who declared the riddle. His anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.\n",
      "But Samson’s wife was given to his companion who had been his friend.\n",
      "But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat. He said, “I will go in to my wife’s room.” But her father wouldn’t allow him to go in.\n",
      "Her father said, “I most certainly thought that you utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her, instead.”\n",
      "Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in the case of the Philistines, when I harm them.”\n",
      "Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the middle between every two tails.\n",
      "When he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.\n",
      "Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” They said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to his companion.” The Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.\n",
      "Samson said to them, “If you behave like this, surely I will take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.”\n",
      "He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cave in Etam’s rock.\n",
      "Then the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.\n",
      "The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.”\n",
      "Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cave in Etam’s rock, and said to Samson, “Don’t you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to me, so have I done to them.”\n",
      "They said to him, “We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.” Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not attack yourselves.”\n",
      "They spoke to him, saying, “No; but we will bind you securely, and deliver you into their hands; but surely we will not kill you.” They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.\n",
      "When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. Then Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.\n",
      "He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, put out his hand, took it, and struck a thousand men with it.\n",
      "Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men.”\n",
      "When he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.\n",
      "He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh, and said, “You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die of thirst, and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”\n",
      "But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day.\n",
      "He judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.\n",
      "Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a prostitute, and went in to her.\n",
      "The Gazites were told, “Samson is here!” They surrounded him, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, “Wait until morning light, then we will kill him.”\n",
      "Samson lay until midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.\n",
      "It came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.\n",
      "The lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, “Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”\n",
      "Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and what you might be bound to afflict you.”\n",
      "Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.”\n",
      "Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.\n",
      "Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner room. She said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He broke the cords, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.\n",
      "Delilah said to Samson, “Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now please tell me with which you might be bound.”\n",
      "He said to her, “If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.”\n",
      "So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” The ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them off his arms like a thread.\n",
      "Delilah said to Samson, “Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you might be bound.” He said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web.”\n",
      "She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.\n",
      "She said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you, ’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies.”\n",
      "When she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, his soul was troubled to death.\n",
      "He told her all his heart, and said to her, “No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will become weak, and be like any other man.”\n",
      "When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hand.\n",
      "She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.\n",
      "She said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” He awoke out of his sleep, and said, “I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free.” But he didn’t know that Yahweh had departed from him.\n",
      "The Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he ground at the mill in the prison.\n",
      "However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.\n",
      "The lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.”\n",
      "When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, “Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand.”\n",
      "When their hearts were merry, they said, “Call for Samson, that he may entertain us.” They called for Samson out of the prison; and he performed before them. They set him between the pillars;\n",
      "and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, “Allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house rests, that I may lean on them.”\n",
      "Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson performed.\n",
      "Samson called to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, only this once, God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.”\n",
      "Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and leaned on them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.\n",
      "Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people who were therein. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his life.\n",
      "Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father. He judged Israel twenty years.\n",
      "There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.\n",
      "He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me. I took it.” His mother said, “May Yahweh bless my son!”\n",
      "He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, then his mother said, “I most certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make an engraved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.”\n",
      "When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, who made an engraved image and a molten image out of it. It was in the house of Micah.\n",
      "The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.\n",
      "There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there.\n",
      "The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he traveled.\n",
      "Micah said to him, “Where did you come from?” He said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking for a place to live.”\n",
      "Micah said to him, “Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food.” So the Levite went in.\n",
      "The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.\n",
      "Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.\n",
      "Then Micah said, “Now know I that Yahweh will do good to me, since I have a Levite as my priest.”\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel. In those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "The children of Dan sent five men of their family from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it. They said to them, “Go, explore the land!” They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.\n",
      "When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; so they turned aside there, and said to him, “Who brought you here? What do you do in this place? What do you have here?”\n",
      "He said to them, “Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I am become his priest.”\n",
      "They said to him, “Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.”\n",
      "The priest said to them, “Go in peace. Your way in which you go is before Yahweh.”\n",
      "Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were there, how they lived in safety, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no one in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone else.\n",
      "They came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brothers asked them, “What do you say?”\n",
      "They said, “Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Do you stand still? Don’t be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.\n",
      "When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.”\n",
      "The family of the Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol, with six hundred men armed with weapons of war.\n",
      "They went up and encamped in Kiriath Jearim, in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan, to this day. Behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.\n",
      "They passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.\n",
      "Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers, “Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you have to do.”\n",
      "They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young Levite man, even to the house of Micah, and asked him how he was doing.\n",
      "The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.\n",
      "The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.\n",
      "When these went into Micah’s house, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”\n",
      "They said to him, “Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”\n",
      "The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went with the people.\n",
      "So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods before them.\n",
      "When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan.\n",
      "As they cried to the children of Dan, they turned their faces, and said to Micah, “What ails you, that you come with such a company?”\n",
      "He said, “You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away! What more do I have? How can you ask me, ‘What ails you?’”\n",
      "The children of Dan said to him, “Don’t let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.”\n",
      "The children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.\n",
      "They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; then they burned the city with fire.\n",
      "There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city, and lived in it.\n",
      "They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; however the name of the city used to be Laish.\n",
      "The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.\n",
      "So they set up for themselves Micah’s engraved image which he made, and it remained all the time that God’s house was in Shiloh.\n",
      "In those days, when there was no king in Israel, there was a certain Levite living on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took for himself a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah.\n",
      "His concubine played the prostitute against him, and went away from him to her father’s house to Bethlehem Judah, and was there for four months.\n",
      "Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of donkeys. She brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.\n",
      "His father-in-law, the young lady’s father, kept him there; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank, and stayed there.\n",
      "On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning, and he rose up to depart. The young lady’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.”\n",
      "So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together. Then the young lady’s father said to the man, “Please be pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.”\n",
      "The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he stayed there again.\n",
      "He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady’s father said, “Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines”; and they both ate.\n",
      "When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady’s father, said to him, “Behold, now the day draws toward evening, please stay all night. Behold, the day is ending. Stay here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go on your way early, that you may go home.”\n",
      "But the man wouldn’t stay that night, but he rose up and departed, and toward Jebus (also called Jerusalem). With him were a couple of saddled donkeys. His concubine also was with him.\n",
      "When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, “Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and stay in it.”\n",
      "His master said to him, “We won’t turn aside into the city of a foreigner that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.”\n",
      "He said to his servant, “Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.”\n",
      "So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.\n",
      "They turned aside there, to go in to stay in Gibeah. He went in, and sat down in the street of the city; for there was no one who took them into his house to stay.\n",
      "Behold, an old man came from his work out of the field at evening. Now the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he lived in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.\n",
      "He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”\n",
      "He said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem Judah. I am going to Yahweh’s house; and there is no one who has taken me into his house.\n",
      "Yet there is both straw and feed for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servants. There is no lack of anything.”\n",
      "The old man said, “Peace be to you; how ever let me supply all your needs. Just don’t sleep in the street.”\n",
      "So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder. Then they washed their feet, and ate and drank.\n",
      "As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, surrounded the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came into your house, that we can have sex with him!”\n",
      "The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, “No, my brothers, please don’t act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, don’t do this folly.\n",
      "Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them what seems good to you; but to this man don’t do any such folly.”\n",
      "But the men wouldn’t listen to him: so the man laid hold of his concubine, and brought her out to them; and they had sex with her, and abused her all night until the morning. When the day began to dawn, they let her go.\n",
      "Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord was, until it was light.\n",
      "Her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.\n",
      "He said to her, “Get up, and let us be going!” but no one answered. Then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.\n",
      "When he had come into his house, he took a knife, and cut up his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.\n",
      "It was so, that all who saw it said, “Such a deed has not been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day! Consider it, take counsel, and speak.”\n",
      "Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.\n",
      "The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.\n",
      "(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel said, “Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?”\n",
      "The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, “I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.\n",
      "The men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house by night. They intended to kill me, and they raped my concubine, and she is dead.\n",
      "I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.\n",
      "Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.”\n",
      "All the people arose as one man, saying, “None of us will go to his tent, neither will any of us turn to his house.\n",
      "But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;\n",
      "and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.”\n",
      "So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.\n",
      "The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What wickedness is this that is happen among you?\n",
      "Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.” But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel.\n",
      "The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.\n",
      "The children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.\n",
      "Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.\n",
      "The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword. All these were men of war.\n",
      "The children of Israel arose, went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God. They asked, “Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?” Yahweh said, “Judah first.”\n",
      "The children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.\n",
      "The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.\n",
      "The children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day destroyed twenty-two thousand of the Israelite men down to the ground.\n",
      "The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.\n",
      "The children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until evening; and they asked of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?” Yahweh said, “Go up against him.”\n",
      "The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.\n",
      "Benjamin went out against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men. All these drew the sword.\n",
      "Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh, and fasted that day until evening; then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.\n",
      "The children of Israel asked Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,\n",
      "and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?” Yahweh said, “Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand.”\n",
      "Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.\n",
      "The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.\n",
      "The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.\n",
      "The children of Benjamin said, “They are struck down before us, as at the first.” But the children of Israel said, “Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.”\n",
      "All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar. Then the ambushers of Israel broke out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.\n",
      "Ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel came over against Gibeah, and the battle was severe; but they didn’t know that disaster was close to them.\n",
      "Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men. All these drew the sword.\n",
      "So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck; for the men of Israel yielded to Benjamin, because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.\n",
      "The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; then the ambushers spread out, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.\n",
      "The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, “Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.”\n",
      "But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole city went up in smoke to the sky.\n",
      "The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that disaster had come on them.\n",
      "Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the middle of it.\n",
      "They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and trod them down at their resting place, as far as near Gibeah toward the sunrise.\n",
      "Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor.\n",
      "They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and they gleaned five thousand men of them in the highways, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck two thousand men of them.\n",
      "So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword. All these were men of valor.\n",
      "But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months.\n",
      "The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found. Moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.\n",
      "Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, “None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.”\n",
      "The people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept severely.\n",
      "They said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there should be one tribe lacking in Israel today?”\n",
      "On the next day, the people rose early, and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.\n",
      "The children of Israel said, “Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up in the assembly to Yahweh?” For they had made a great oath concerning him who didn’t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”\n",
      "The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, “There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.\n",
      "How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?”\n",
      "They said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?” Behold, no one came from Jabesh Gilead to the camp to the assembly.\n",
      "For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.\n",
      "The congregation sent twelve thousand of the most valiant men there, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.\n",
      "This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain with a man.”\n",
      "They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.\n",
      "Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead. There still weren’t enough for them.\n",
      "The people grieved for Benjamin, because Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "Then the elders of the congregation said, “How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?”\n",
      "They said, “There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.\n",
      "However we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, ‘Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.’”\n",
      "They said, “Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.”\n",
      "They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,\n",
      "and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.\n",
      "It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously to us, because we didn’t take for each man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, otherwise you would now be guilty.’”\n",
      "The children of Benjamin did so, and took wives for themselves, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them.\n",
      "The children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they each went out from there to his own inheritance.\n",
      "In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.\n",
      "In the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land. A certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to live in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.\n",
      "The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi. The names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah. They came into the country of Moab, and lived there.\n",
      "Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left with her two sons.\n",
      "They took for themselves wives of the women of Moab. The name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other was Ruth. They lived there about ten years.\n",
      "Mahlon and Chilion both died, and the woman was bereaved of her two children and of her husband.\n",
      "Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab; for she had heard in the country of Moab how Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.\n",
      "She went out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her. They went on the way to return to the land of Judah.\n",
      "Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to her mother’s house. May Yahweh deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.\n",
      "May Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.” Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices, and wept.\n",
      "They said to her, “No, but we will return with you to your people.”\n",
      "Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why do you want to go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?\n",
      "Go back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, ‘I have hope, ’ if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;\n",
      "would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me seriously for your sakes, for Yahweh’s hand has gone out against me.”\n",
      "They lifted up their voices, and wept again; then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.\n",
      "She said, “Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people, and to her god. Follow your sister-in-law.”\n",
      "Ruth said, “Don’t urge me to leave you, and to return from following you, for where you go, I will go; and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God.\n",
      "Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me.”\n",
      "When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.\n",
      "So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. When they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was excited about them, and they asked, “Is this Naomi?”\n",
      "She said to them, “Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.\n",
      "I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?”\n",
      "So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab. They came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.\n",
      "Naomi had a relative of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.\n",
      "Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor.” She said to her, “Go, my daughter.”\n",
      "She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.\n",
      "Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.” They answered him, “May Yahweh bless you.”\n",
      "Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?”\n",
      "The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.\n",
      "She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.”\n",
      "Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.\n",
      "Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.”\n",
      "Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?”\n",
      "Boaz answered her, “I have been fully told about all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before.\n",
      "May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”\n",
      "Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.”\n",
      "At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.” She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left some of it.\n",
      "When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t reproach her.\n",
      "Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.”\n",
      "So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.\n",
      "She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough.\n",
      "Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.” She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”\n",
      "Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.”\n",
      "Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men, until they have finished all my harvest.’”\n",
      "Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.”\n",
      "So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.\n",
      "Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?\n",
      "Now isn’t Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he will be winnowing barley tonight on the threshing floor.\n",
      "Therefore wash yourself, anoint yourself, get dressed, and go down to the threshing floor, but don’t make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.\n",
      "It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall note the place where he is lying. Then you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lay down. Then he will tell you what to do.”\n",
      "She said to her, “All that you say, I will do.”\n",
      "She went down to the threshing floor, and did everything that her mother-in-law told her.\n",
      "When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. She came softly, uncovered his feet, and laid down.\n",
      "At midnight, the man was startled and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.\n",
      "He said, “Who are you?” She answered, “I am Ruth your handmaid. Therefore spread the corner of your garment over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.”\n",
      "He said, “You are blessed by Yahweh, my daughter. You have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, because you didn’t follow young men, whether poor or rich.\n",
      "Now, my daughter, don’t be afraid. I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people knows that you are a worthy woman.\n",
      "Now it is true that I am a near kinsman. However, there is a kinsman nearer than I.\n",
      "Stay this night, and in the morning, if he will perform for you the part of a kinsman, good. Let him do the kinsman’s duty. But if he will not do the duty of a kinsman for you, then I will do the duty of a kinsman for you, as Yahweh lives. Lie down until the morning.”\n",
      "She lay at his feet until the morning, then she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”\n",
      "He said, “Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it.” She held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; then he went into the city.\n",
      "When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did it go, my daughter?” She told her all that the man had done for her.\n",
      "She said, “He gave me these six measures of barley; for he said, ‘Don’t go empty to your mother-in-law.’”\n",
      "Then she said, “Wait, my daughter, until you know what will happen; for the man will not rest until he has settled this today.”\n",
      "Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there. Behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by. He said to him, “Come over here, friend, and sit down!” He turned aside, and sat down.\n",
      "He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here, ” and they sat down.\n",
      "He said to the near kinsman, “Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s.\n",
      "I thought I should tell you, saying, ‘Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.’ If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.” He said, “I will redeem it.”\n",
      "Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.”\n",
      "The near kinsman said, “I can’t redeem it for myself, lest I endanger my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can’t redeem it.”\n",
      "Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man took off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the way of legalizing transactions in Israel.\n",
      "So the near kinsman said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself, ” then he took off his shoe.\n",
      "Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, “You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi.\n",
      "Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses today.”\n",
      "All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which both built the house of Israel; and treat you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem.\n",
      "Let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the offspring which Yahweh will give you by this young woman.”\n",
      "So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh enabled her to conceive, and she bore a son.\n",
      "The women said to Naomi, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you today without a near kinsman. Let his name be famous in Israel.\n",
      "He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”\n",
      "Naomi took the child, and laid him in her bosom, and became nurse to it.\n",
      "The women, her neighbors, gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi”. They named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.\n",
      "Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,\n",
      "and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,\n",
      "and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,\n",
      "and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,\n",
      "and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.\n",
      "Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:\n",
      "and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.\n",
      "This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.\n",
      "When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:\n",
      "but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.\n",
      "Her rival provoked her severely, to make her fret, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.\n",
      "As he did so year by year, when she went up to Yahweh’s house, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and didn’t eat.\n",
      "Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”\n",
      "So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh’s temple.\n",
      "She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, and wept bitterly.\n",
      "She vowed a vow, and said, “Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.”\n",
      "As she continued praying before Yahweh, Eli saw her mouth.\n",
      "Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.\n",
      "Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunken? Put away your wine from you.”\n",
      "Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.\n",
      "Don’t count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation.”\n",
      "Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.”\n",
      "She said, “Let your handmaid find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn’t sad any more.\n",
      "They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.\n",
      "When the time had come, Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked him of Yahweh.”\n",
      "The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.\n",
      "But Hannah didn’t go up; for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and stay there forever.”\n",
      "Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may Yahweh establish his word.” So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.\n",
      "When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to Yahweh’s house in Shiloh. The child was young.\n",
      "They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.\n",
      "She said, “Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.\n",
      "For this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him.\n",
      "Therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh. As long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh.” He worshiped Yahweh there.\n",
      "Hannah prayed, and said: “My heart exults in Yahweh! My horn is exalted in Yahweh. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation.\n",
      "There is no one as holy as Yahweh, For there is no one besides you, nor is there any rock like our God.\n",
      "“Talk no more so exceeding proudly. Don’t let arrogance come out of your mouth, For Yahweh is a God of knowledge. By him actions are weighed.\n",
      "“The bows of the mighty men are broken. Those who stumbled are armed with strength.\n",
      "Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread. Those who were hungry are satisfied. Yes, the barren has borne seven. She who has many children languishes.\n",
      "“Yahweh kills, and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.\n",
      "Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich. He brings low, he also lifts up.\n",
      "He raises up the poor out of the dust. He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh’s. He has set the world on them.\n",
      "He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for no man shall prevail by strength.\n",
      "Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces. He will thunder against them in the sky. “Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.”\n",
      "Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest.\n",
      "Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn’t know Yahweh.\n",
      "The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;\n",
      "and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.\n",
      "Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.”\n",
      "If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires”; then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.”\n",
      "The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.\n",
      "But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.\n",
      "Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.\n",
      "Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, “Yahweh give you offspring from this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.” They went to their own home.\n",
      "Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.\n",
      "Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.\n",
      "He said to them, “Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.\n",
      "No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make Yahweh’s people disobey.\n",
      "If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him?” Notwithstanding, they didn’t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh intended to kill them.\n",
      "The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.\n",
      "A man of God came to Eli, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Did I reveal myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?\n",
      "Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? Did I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?\n",
      "Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’\n",
      "“Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever.’ But now Yahweh says, ‘Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.\n",
      "Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.\n",
      "You shall see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.\n",
      "The man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall consume your eyes, and grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.\n",
      "“‘This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall both die.\n",
      "I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever.\n",
      "It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, “Please put me into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.”’”\n",
      "The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli. Yahweh’s word was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.\n",
      "At that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),\n",
      "and the lamp of God hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh’s temple, where the ark of God was;\n",
      "Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, “Here I am.”\n",
      "He ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” He said, “I didn’t call; lie down again.” He went and lay down.\n",
      "Yahweh called yet again, “Samuel!” Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” He answered, “I didn’t call, my son; lie down again.”\n",
      "Now Samuel didn’t yet know Yahweh, neither was Yahweh’s word yet revealed to him.\n",
      "Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.” Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.\n",
      "Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.\n",
      "Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” Then Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant hears.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Samuel, “Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.\n",
      "In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.\n",
      "For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them.\n",
      "Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be removed with sacrifice nor offering forever.”\n",
      "Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of Yahweh’s house. Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.\n",
      "Then Eli called Samuel, and said, “Samuel, my son!” He said, “Here I am.”\n",
      "He said, “What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please don’t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you.”\n",
      "Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him. He said, “It is Yahweh. Let him do what seems good to him.”\n",
      "Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.\n",
      "All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by Yahweh’s word.\n",
      "The word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.\n",
      "The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was struck before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men.\n",
      "When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.”\n",
      "So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits above the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.\n",
      "When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.\n",
      "When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” They understood that Yahweh’s ark had come into the camp.\n",
      "The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” They said, “Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before.\n",
      "Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.\n",
      "Be strong, and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!”\n",
      "The Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.\n",
      "The ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.\n",
      "There ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with earth on his head.\n",
      "When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.\n",
      "When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, “What does the noise of this tumult mean?” The man hurried, and came and told Eli.\n",
      "Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.\n",
      "The man said to Eli, “I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army.” He said, “How did the matter go, my son?”\n",
      "He who brought the news answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”\n",
      "When he made mention of the ark of God, Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.\n",
      "His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered. When she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth; for her pains came on her.\n",
      "About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Don’t be afraid; for you have given birth to a son.” But she didn’t answer, neither did she regard it.\n",
      "She named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel”; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.\n",
      "She said, “The glory has departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.”\n",
      "Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.\n",
      "The Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.\n",
      "When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before Yahweh’s ark. They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.\n",
      "When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before Yahweh’s ark; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold. Only Dagon’s torso was intact.\n",
      "Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.\n",
      "But the hand of Yahweh was heavy on them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod and its borders.\n",
      "When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us; for his hand is severe on us, and on Dagon our god.”\n",
      "They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath.” They carried the ark of the God of Israel there.\n",
      "It was so, that after they had carried it about, the hand of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion: and he struck the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors broke out on them.\n",
      "So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.”\n",
      "They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly confusion throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.\n",
      "The men who didn’t die were struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.\n",
      "Yahweh’s ark was in the country of the Philistines seven months.\n",
      "The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with Yahweh’s ark? Show us with which we shall send it to its place.”\n",
      "They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, don’t send it empty; but by all means return him a trespass offering: then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.”\n",
      "Then they said, “What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?” They said, “Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, for the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.\n",
      "Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.\n",
      "Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had worked wonderfully among them, didn’t they let the people go, and they departed?\n",
      "“Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart, and two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke; and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;\n",
      "and take Yahweh’s ark, and lay it on the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which you return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by its side; and send it away, that it may go.\n",
      "Behold; if it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it was a chance that happened to us.”\n",
      "The men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;\n",
      "and they put Yahweh’s ark on the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.\n",
      "The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and didn’t turn aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.\n",
      "They of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.\n",
      "The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Yahweh.\n",
      "The Levites took down Yahweh’s ark, and the coffer that was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh.\n",
      "When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.\n",
      "These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to Yahweh: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;\n",
      "and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone, whereon they set down Yahweh’s ark. That stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.\n",
      "He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into Yahweh’s ark, he struck of the people fifty thousand seventy men; and the people mourned, because Yahweh had struck the people with a great slaughter.\n",
      "The men of Beth Shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? To whom shall he go up from us?”\n",
      "They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back Yahweh’s ark. Come down, and bring it up to yourselves.”\n",
      "The men of Kiriath Jearim came, and took Yahweh’s ark, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep Yahweh’s ark.\n",
      "From the day that the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.\n",
      "Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you do return to Yahweh with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to Yahweh, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.”\n",
      "Then the children of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served Yahweh only.\n",
      "Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you to Yahweh.”\n",
      "They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Yahweh, and fasted on that day, and said there, “We have sinned against Yahweh.” Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.\n",
      "When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.\n",
      "The children of Israel said to Samuel, “Don’t cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.”\n",
      "Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Yahweh: and Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel; and Yahweh answered him.\n",
      "As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.\n",
      "The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.\n",
      "Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, “Yahweh helped us until now.”\n",
      "So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel. The hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.\n",
      "The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.\n",
      "Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.\n",
      "He went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.\n",
      "His return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar to Yahweh.\n",
      "When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel.\n",
      "Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beersheba.\n",
      "His sons didn’t walk in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.\n",
      "Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel to Ramah;\n",
      "and they said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons don’t walk in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.”\n",
      "But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” Samuel prayed to Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.\n",
      "According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to you.\n",
      "Now therefore listen to their voice: however you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who shall reign over them.”\n",
      "Samuel told all Yahweh’s words to the people who asked of him a king.\n",
      "He said, “This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them to him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;\n",
      "and he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.\n",
      "He will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.\n",
      "He will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, even their best, and give them to his servants.\n",
      "He will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.\n",
      "He will take your male servants, and your female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work.\n",
      "He will take the tenth of your flocks: and you shall be his servants.\n",
      "You shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall have chosen you; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day.”\n",
      "But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No; but we will have a king over us,\n",
      "that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.”\n",
      "Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and make them a king.” Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Every man go to his city.”\n",
      "Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.\n",
      "He had a son, whose name was Saul, an impressive young man; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he. From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.\n",
      "The donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. Kish said to Saul his son, “Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.”\n",
      "He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn’t find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they weren’t there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn’t find them.\n",
      "When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, and let us return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys, and be anxious for us.”\n",
      "He said to him, “See now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor. All that he says comes surely to pass. Now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.”\n",
      "Then Saul said to his servant, “But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?”\n",
      "The servant answered Saul again, and said, “Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.”\n",
      "(In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, “Come, and let us go to the seer”; for he who is now called a prophet was before called a Seer.)\n",
      "Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said. Come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.\n",
      "As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”\n",
      "They answered them, and said, “He is. Behold, he is before you. Hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place.\n",
      "As soon as you have come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he blesses the sacrifice. Afterwards those who are invited eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you shall find him.”\n",
      "They went up to the city. As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.\n",
      "Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,\n",
      "“Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry has come to me.”\n",
      "When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, “Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! this same shall have authority over my people.”\n",
      "Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”\n",
      "Samuel answered Saul, and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.\n",
      "As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don’t set your mind on them; for they are found. For whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father’s house?”\n",
      "Saul answered, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me like this?”\n",
      "Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.\n",
      "Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it aside.’”\n",
      "The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. Samuel said, “Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before yourself and eat; because for the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.\n",
      "When they had come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.\n",
      "They arose early: and about daybreak, Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, “Get up, that I may send you away.” Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.\n",
      "As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant pass on before us” (and he passed on), “but stand still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.”\n",
      "Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, “Isn’t it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?\n",
      "When you have departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Rachel’s tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will tell you, ‘The donkeys which you went to seek have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, “What shall I do for my son?”’\n",
      "“Then you shall go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and three men shall meet you there going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:\n",
      "and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand.\n",
      "“After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall happen, when you have come there to the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:\n",
      "and Yahweh’s Spirit will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.\n",
      "Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.\n",
      "“You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: you shall wait seven days, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.”\n",
      "It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs happened that day.\n",
      "When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.\n",
      "When all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said to one another, “What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”\n",
      "One of the same place answered, “Who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”\n",
      "When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.\n",
      "Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” He said, “To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.”\n",
      "Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”\n",
      "Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys were found.” But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn’t tell him.\n",
      "Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;\n",
      "and he said to the children of Israel, “Yahweh says, the God of Israel, ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you: ’\n",
      "but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, ‘No! Set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes, and by your thousands.”\n",
      "So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.\n",
      "He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.\n",
      "Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, “Is there yet a man to come here?” Yahweh answered, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.”\n",
      "They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.\n",
      "Samuel said to all the people, “You see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people?” All the people shouted, and said, “Let the king live!”\n",
      "Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.\n",
      "Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the army, whose hearts God had touched.\n",
      "But certain worthless fellows said, “How shall this man save us?” They despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.\n",
      "Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.”\n",
      "Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel.”\n",
      "The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you.”\n",
      "Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.\n",
      "Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, “What ails the people that they weep?” They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.\n",
      "The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.\n",
      "He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever doesn’t come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.” The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.\n",
      "He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.\n",
      "They said to the messengers who came, “Thus you shall tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.’” The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.\n",
      "Therefore the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.”\n",
      "On the next day, Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the middle of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day. Those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.\n",
      "The people said to Samuel, “Who is he who said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring those men, that we may put them to death!”\n",
      "Saul said, “There shall not a man be put to death this day; for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel.”\n",
      "Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.”\n",
      "All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.\n",
      "Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.\n",
      "Now, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth to this day.\n",
      "Here I am. Witness against me before Yahweh, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes therewith? I will restore it to you.”\n",
      "They said, “You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any man’s hand.”\n",
      "He said to them, “Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” They said, “He is witness.”\n",
      "Samuel said to the people, “It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh, which he did to you and to your fathers.\n",
      "“When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.\n",
      "“But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.\n",
      "They cried to Yahweh, and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.’\n",
      "Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.\n",
      "“When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us; ’ when Yahweh your God was your king.\n",
      "Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for: and behold, Yahweh has set a king over you.\n",
      "If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God.\n",
      "But if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh, but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then will the hand of Yahweh be against you, as it was against your fathers.\n",
      "“Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh will do before your eyes.\n",
      "Isn’t it wheat harvest today? I will call to Yahweh, that he may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of Yahweh, in asking for a king.”\n",
      "So Samuel called to Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.\n",
      "All the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.”\n",
      "Samuel said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. You have indeed done all this evil; yet don’t turn aside from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your heart.\n",
      "Don’t turn aside to go after vain things which can’t profit nor deliver, for they are vain.\n",
      "For Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself.\n",
      "Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.\n",
      "Only fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he has done for you.\n",
      "But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king.”\n",
      "Saul reigned a year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,\n",
      "Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.\n",
      "Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”\n",
      "All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.\n",
      "The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.\n",
      "When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.\n",
      "Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.\n",
      "He stayed seven days, according to the time set by Samuel: but Samuel didn’t come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.\n",
      "Saul said, “Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the peace offerings.” He offered the burnt offering.\n",
      "It came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.\n",
      "Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn’t come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;\n",
      "therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven’t entreated the favor of Yahweh.’ I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.”\n",
      "Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever.\n",
      "But now your kingdom shall not continue. Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.”\n",
      "Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.\n",
      "Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.\n",
      "The raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;\n",
      "and another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.\n",
      "Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears”;\n",
      "but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, mattock, ax, and sickle;\n",
      "yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.\n",
      "So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.\n",
      "The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.\n",
      "Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on the other side.” But he didn’t tell his father.\n",
      "Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men;\n",
      "and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people didn’t know that Jonathan was gone.\n",
      "Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.\n",
      "The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.\n",
      "Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint on Yahweh to save by many or by few.”\n",
      "His armor bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Turn and, behold, I am with you according to your heart.”\n",
      "Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will reveal ourselves to them.\n",
      "If they say thus to us, ‘Wait until we come to you!’ then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.\n",
      "But if they say this, ‘Come up to us!’ then we will go up; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand. This shall be the sign to us.”\n",
      "Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, “Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!”\n",
      "The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something!” Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me; for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.”\n",
      "Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.\n",
      "That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.\n",
      "There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the raiders, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.\n",
      "The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and scattered.\n",
      "Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count now, and see who is missing from us.” When they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.\n",
      "Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God was with the children of Israel at that time.\n",
      "While Saul talked to the priest, the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand!”\n",
      "Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow: a very great confusion.\n",
      "Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them into the camp, from all around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.\n",
      "Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.\n",
      "So Yahweh saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.\n",
      "The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.\n",
      "All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.\n",
      "When the people had come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.\n",
      "But Jonathan didn’t hear when his father commanded the people with the oath: therefore he put out the end of the rod who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.\n",
      "Then one of the people answered, and said, “Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food this day.’” The people were faint.\n",
      "Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.\n",
      "How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the plunder of their enemies which they found? For now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.”\n",
      "They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;\n",
      "and the people flew on the plunder, and took sheep, and cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.\n",
      "Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against Yahweh, in that they eat meat with the blood.” He said, “You have dealt treacherously. Roll a large stone to me this day!”\n",
      "Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, ‘Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don’t sin against Yahweh in eating meat with the blood.’” All the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there.\n",
      "Saul built an altar to Yahweh. This was the first altar that he built to Yahweh.\n",
      "Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take plunder among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.” They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” Then the priest said, “Let us draw near here to God.”\n",
      "Saul asked counsel of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But he didn’t answer him that day.\n",
      "Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been this day.\n",
      "For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.\n",
      "Then he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”\n",
      "Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, “Show the right.” Jonathan and Saul were chosen; but the people escaped.\n",
      "Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.” Jonathan was selected.\n",
      "Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done!” Jonathan told him, and said, “I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.”\n",
      "Saul said, “God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”\n",
      "The people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day!” So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn’t die.\n",
      "Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.\n",
      "Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he defeated them.\n",
      "He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.\n",
      "Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:\n",
      "and the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.\n",
      "Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.\n",
      "There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him.\n",
      "Samuel said to Saul, “Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel. Now therefore listen to the voice of Yahweh’s words.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies says, ‘I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way, when he came up out of Egypt.\n",
      "Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don’t spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”\n",
      "Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.\n",
      "Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.\n",
      "Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.\n",
      "Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.\n",
      "He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and wouldn’t utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s word came to Samuel, saying,\n",
      "“It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.” Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.\n",
      "Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.”\n",
      "Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, “You are blessed by Yahweh! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.”\n",
      "Samuel said, “Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?”\n",
      "Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. We have utterly destroyed the rest.”\n",
      "Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me last night.” He said to him, “Say on.”\n",
      "Samuel said, “Though you were little in your own sight, weren’t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;\n",
      "and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, ‘Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’\n",
      "Why then didn’t you obey the voice of Yahweh, but took the plunder, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?”\n",
      "Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.\n",
      "But the people took of the plunder, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.”\n",
      "Samuel said, “Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.\n",
      "For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected Yahweh’s word, he has also rejected you from being king.”\n",
      "Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.\n",
      "Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.”\n",
      "Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected Yahweh’s word, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.”\n",
      "As Samuel turned about to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore.\n",
      "Samuel said to him, “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.\n",
      "Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.”\n",
      "Then he said, “I have sinned: yet please honor me now before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.”\n",
      "So Samuel went back with Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.\n",
      "Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites!” Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”\n",
      "Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women!” Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.\n",
      "Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.\n",
      "Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided a king for myself among his sons.”\n",
      "Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” Yahweh said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.\n",
      "Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.”\n",
      "Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”\n",
      "He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.\n",
      "When they had come, he looked at Eliab, and said, “Surely Yahweh’s anointed is before him.”\n",
      "But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Don’t look on his face, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for I see not as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.”\n",
      "Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Neither has Yahweh chosen this one.”\n",
      "Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, “Neither has Yahweh chosen this one.”\n",
      "Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen these.”\n",
      "Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your children here?” He said, “There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is keeping the sheep.” Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.”\n",
      "He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on. Yahweh said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is he.”\n",
      "Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.\n",
      "Now Yahweh’s Spirit departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.\n",
      "Saul’s servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.\n",
      "Let our lord now command your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. It shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.”\n",
      "Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.”\n",
      "Then one of the young men answered, and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.”\n",
      "Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.”\n",
      "Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.\n",
      "David came to Saul, and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.\n",
      "Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight.”\n",
      "When the spirit from God was on Saul, David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.\n",
      "Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.\n",
      "Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.\n",
      "The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.\n",
      "There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.\n",
      "He had a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.\n",
      "He had brass shin armor on his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.\n",
      "The staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. His shield bearer went before him.\n",
      "He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.\n",
      "If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then you will be our servants, and serve us.”\n",
      "The Philistine said, “I defy the armies of Israel this day! Give me a man, that we may fight together!”\n",
      "When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.\n",
      "Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken among men.\n",
      "The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.\n",
      "David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.\n",
      "Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.\n",
      "The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.\n",
      "Jesse said to David his son, “Now take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;\n",
      "and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers are doing, and bring back news.”\n",
      "Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.\n",
      "David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the army which was going out to the fight shouted for the battle.\n",
      "Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.\n",
      "David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.\n",
      "As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.\n",
      "All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were terrified.\n",
      "The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? He has surely come up to defy Israel. It shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.”\n",
      "David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”\n",
      "The people answered him in this way, saying, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.”\n",
      "Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle.”\n",
      "David said, “What have I now done? Is there not a cause?”\n",
      "He turned away from him toward another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way.\n",
      "When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.\n",
      "David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”\n",
      "Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.”\n",
      "David said to Saul, “Your servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb out of the flock,\n",
      "I went out after him, and struck him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.\n",
      "Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.”\n",
      "David said, “Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.” Saul said to David, “Go; and Yahweh shall be with you.”\n",
      "Saul dressed David with his clothing. He put a helmet of brass on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.\n",
      "David strapped his sword on his clothing, and he tried to move; for he had not tested it. David said to Saul, “I can’t go with these; for I have not tested them.” David took them off.\n",
      "He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in his wallet. His sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine.\n",
      "The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.\n",
      "When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair face.\n",
      "The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods.\n",
      "The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field.”\n",
      "Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.\n",
      "Today, Yahweh will deliver you into my hand. I will strike you, and take your head from off you. I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,\n",
      "and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn’t save with sword and spear: for the battle is Yahweh’s, and he will give you into our hand.”\n",
      "When the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.\n",
      "David put his hand in his bag, took a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.\n",
      "So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.\n",
      "Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him, and cut off his head therewith. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.\n",
      "The men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.\n",
      "The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.\n",
      "David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.\n",
      "When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?” Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I can’t tell.”\n",
      "The king said, “Inquire whose son the young man is!”\n",
      "As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.\n",
      "Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, you young man?” David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”\n",
      "When he had made an end of speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.\n",
      "Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.\n",
      "Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.\n",
      "Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his clothing, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his sash.\n",
      "David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.\n",
      "As they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.\n",
      "The women sang to one another as they played, and said, “Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands.”\n",
      "Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands. What can he have more but the kingdom?”\n",
      "Saul eyed David from that day and forward.\n",
      "On the next day, an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house. David played with his hand, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;\n",
      "and Saul threw the spear; for he said, “I will pin David even to the wall!” David escaped from his presence twice.\n",
      "Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him, and was departed from Saul.\n",
      "Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.\n",
      "David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Yahweh was with him.\n",
      "When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.\n",
      "But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.\n",
      "Saul said to David, “Behold, my elder daughter Merab, I will give her to you as wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight Yahweh’s battles.” For Saul said, “Don’t let my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.”\n",
      "David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”\n",
      "But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.\n",
      "Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.\n",
      "Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, “You shall this day be my son-in-law a second time.”\n",
      "Saul commanded his servants, “Talk with David secretly, and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.’”\n",
      "Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, “Does it seems to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?”\n",
      "The servants of Saul told him, saying, “David spoke like this.”\n",
      "Saul said, “You shall tell David, ‘The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies.’” Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. The days were not expired;\n",
      "and David arose and went, he and his men, and killed of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.\n",
      "Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.\n",
      "Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.\n",
      "Then the princes of the Philistines went out: and as often as they went out, David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was highly esteemed.\n",
      "Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted much in David.\n",
      "Jonathan told David, saying, “Saul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself.\n",
      "I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my father about you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.”\n",
      "Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Don’t let the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you;\n",
      "for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?”\n",
      "Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, “As Yahweh lives, he shall not be put to death.”\n",
      "Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as before.\n",
      "There was war again. David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.\n",
      "An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.\n",
      "Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled, and escaped that night.\n",
      "Saul sent messengers to David’s house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning. Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you don’t save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”\n",
      "So Michal let David down through the window. He went, fled, and escaped.\n",
      "Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head, and covered it with the clothes.\n",
      "When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”\n",
      "Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.”\n",
      "When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’ hair at its head.\n",
      "Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he is escaped?” Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’”\n",
      "Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.\n",
      "It was told Saul, saying, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.”\n",
      "Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.\n",
      "When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.\n",
      "Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” One said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.”\n",
      "He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then the Spirit of God came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.\n",
      "He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”\n",
      "David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”\n",
      "He said to him, “Far from it; you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so.”\n",
      "David swore moreover, and said, “Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says, ‘Don’t let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: ’ but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.”\n",
      "Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.”\n",
      "David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.\n",
      "If your father miss me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’\n",
      "If he says, ‘It is well; ’ your servant shall have peace: but if he be angry, then know that evil is determined by him.\n",
      "Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you: but if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?”\n",
      "Jonathan said, “Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then wouldn’t I tell you that?”\n",
      "Then David said to Jonathan, “Who shall tell me if perchance your father answers you roughly?”\n",
      "Jonathan said to David, “Come, and let us go out into the field.” They both went out into the field.\n",
      "Jonathan said to David, “By Yahweh, the God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is good toward David, shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?\n",
      "Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I don’t disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and Yahweh be with you, as he has been with my father.\n",
      "You shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness of Yahweh, that I not die;\n",
      "but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth.”\n",
      "So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “Yahweh will require it at the hand of David’s enemies.”\n",
      "Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.\n",
      "Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.\n",
      "When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.\n",
      "I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark.\n",
      "Behold, I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ If I tell the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are on this side of you. Take them; ’ then come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as Yahweh lives.\n",
      "But if I say this to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you; ’ then go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.\n",
      "Concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, Yahweh is between you and me forever.”\n",
      "So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon had come, the king sat him down to eat food.\n",
      "The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side: but David’s place was empty.\n",
      "Nevertheless Saul didn’t say anything that day: for he thought, “Something has happened to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean.”\n",
      "On the next day after the new moon, the second day, David’s place was empty. Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why doesn’t the son of Jesse come to eat, neither yesterday, nor today?”\n",
      "Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.\n",
      "He said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the king’s table.”\n",
      "Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?\n",
      "For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!”\n",
      "Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”\n",
      "Saul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.\n",
      "So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.\n",
      "In the morning, Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.\n",
      "He said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.\n",
      "When the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?”\n",
      "Jonathan cried after the boy, “Go fast! Hurry! Don’t delay!” Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.\n",
      "But the boy didn’t know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.\n",
      "Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.”\n",
      "As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another, and wept one with another, and David wept the most.\n",
      "Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, because we have both sworn in Yahweh’s name, saying, ‘Yahweh shall be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.’” He arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.\n",
      "Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no man with you?”\n",
      "David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, ‘Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you; and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.’\n",
      "Now therefore what is under your hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.”\n",
      "The priest answered David, and said, “There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.”\n",
      "David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us about these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?”\n",
      "So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.\n",
      "Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.\n",
      "David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”\n",
      "The priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.” David said, “There is none like that. Give it to me.”\n",
      "David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.\n",
      "The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Didn’t they sing to one another about him in dances, saying, ‘Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?’”\n",
      "David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.\n",
      "He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.\n",
      "Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?\n",
      "Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?”\n",
      "David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him.\n",
      "Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.\n",
      "David went there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother come out with you, until I know what God will do for me.”\n",
      "He brought them before the king of Moab; and they lived with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.\n",
      "The prophet Gad said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold. Depart, and go into the land of Judah.” Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.\n",
      "Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.\n",
      "Saul said to his servants who stood about him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,\n",
      "that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes a treaty with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?”\n",
      "Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.\n",
      "He inquired of Yahweh for him, gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”\n",
      "Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob: and they all came to the king.\n",
      "Saul said, “Hear now, you son of Ahitub.” He answered, “Here I am, my lord.”\n",
      "Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?”\n",
      "Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, “Who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?\n",
      "Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? Be it far from me! Don’t let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more.”\n",
      "The king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father’s house.”\n",
      "The king said to the guard who stood about him, “Turn, and kill the priests of Yahweh; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and didn’t disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king wouldn’t put out their hand to fall on the priests of Yahweh.\n",
      "The king said to Doeg, “Turn and attack the priests!” Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five people who wore a linen ephod.\n",
      "He struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies, and cattle and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.\n",
      "One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.\n",
      "Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh’s priests.\n",
      "David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father’s house.\n",
      "Stay with me, don’t be afraid; for he who seeks my life seeks your life. For with me you shall be in safeguard.”\n",
      "David was told, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.”\n",
      "Therefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go and strike these Philistines?” Yahweh said to David, “Go strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.”\n",
      "David’s men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”\n",
      "Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again. Yahweh answered him, and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”\n",
      "David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.\n",
      "When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand.\n",
      "It was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars.”\n",
      "Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.\n",
      "David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”\n",
      "Then David said, “O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.\n",
      "Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant.” Yahweh said, “He will come down.”\n",
      "Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” Yahweh said, “They will deliver you up.”\n",
      "Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. It was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he gave up going there.\n",
      "David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God didn’t deliver him into his hand.\n",
      "David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.\n",
      "Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the woods, and strengthened his hand in God.\n",
      "He said to him, “Don’t be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.”\n",
      "They both made a covenant before Yahweh: and David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his house.\n",
      "Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?\n",
      "Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.”\n",
      "Saul said, “You are blessed by Yahweh; for you have had compassion on me.\n",
      "Please go make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for it is told me that he deals very subtly.\n",
      "See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come again to me with certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall happen, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”\n",
      "They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.\n",
      "Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.\n",
      "Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.\n",
      "But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!”\n",
      "So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.\n",
      "David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.\n",
      "When Saul was returned from following the Philistines, it was told him, saying, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.”\n",
      "Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.\n",
      "He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.\n",
      "The men of David said to him, “Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.’” Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe secretly.\n",
      "Afterward, David’s heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.\n",
      "He said to his men, “Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, since he is Yahweh’s anointed.”\n",
      "So David checked his men with these words, and didn’t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.\n",
      "David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect.\n",
      "David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to men’s words, saying, ‘Behold, David seeks your hurt?’\n",
      "Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not stretch out my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh’s anointed.\n",
      "Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn’t kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it.\n",
      "May Yahweh judge between me and you, and may Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand shall not be on you.\n",
      "As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness; ’ but my hand shall not be on you.\n",
      "Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?\n",
      "May Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.”\n",
      "It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you.\n",
      "You have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn’t kill me.\n",
      "For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day.\n",
      "Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.\n",
      "Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father’s house.”\n",
      "David swore to Saul. Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold.\n",
      "Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.\n",
      "There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.\n",
      "Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful face: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.\n",
      "David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.\n",
      "David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.\n",
      "You shall tell him, ‘Long life to you! Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.\n",
      "Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we didn’t hurt them, neither was there anything missing from them, all the while they were in Carmel.\n",
      "Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.’”\n",
      "When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.\n",
      "Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants who break away from their masters these days.\n",
      "Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don’t know where they come from?”\n",
      "So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.\n",
      "David said to his men, “Every man put on his sword!” Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David; and two hundred stayed by the baggage.\n",
      "But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to Greet our master; and he railed at them.\n",
      "But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.\n",
      "They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.\n",
      "Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can’t speak to him.”\n",
      "Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two bottles of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five measures of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.\n",
      "She said to her young men, “Go on before me. Behold, I come after you.” But she didn’t tell her husband, Nabal.\n",
      "It was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.\n",
      "Now David had said, “Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good.\n",
      "God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.”\n",
      "When Abigail saw David, she hurried, and alighted from her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.\n",
      "She fell at his feet, and said, “On me, my lord, on me be the iniquity; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears. Hear the words of your handmaid.\n",
      "Please don’t let my lord regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your handmaid, didn’t see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.\n",
      "Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, since Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.\n",
      "Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.\n",
      "Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid. For Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh; and evil shall not be found in you all your days.\n",
      "Though men may rise up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God. He will sling out the souls of your enemies, as from the hollow of a sling.\n",
      "It shall come to pass, when Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you prince over Israel,\n",
      "that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. When Yahweh has dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.”\n",
      "David said to Abigail, “Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!\n",
      "Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.\n",
      "For indeed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn’t have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.”\n",
      "So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request.”\n",
      "Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken. Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.\n",
      "In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.\n",
      "About ten days later, Yahweh struck Nabal, so that he died.\n",
      "When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed is Yahweh, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil. Yahweh has returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.” David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him as wife.\n",
      "When the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.”\n",
      "She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, “Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”\n",
      "Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.\n",
      "David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they both became his wives.\n",
      "Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.\n",
      "The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?”\n",
      "Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.\n",
      "Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.\n",
      "David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come.\n",
      "David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him.\n",
      "Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?” Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”\n",
      "So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay around him.\n",
      "Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered up your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.”\n",
      "David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against Yahweh’s anointed, and be guiltless?”\n",
      "David said, “As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.\n",
      "Yahweh forbid that I should stretch out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed; but now please take the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go.”\n",
      "So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul’s head; and they went away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Yahweh was fallen on them.\n",
      "Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;\n",
      "and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Don’t you answer, Abner?” Then Abner answered, “Who are you who cries to the king?”\n",
      "David said to Abner, “Aren’t you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.\n",
      "This thing isn’t good that you have done. As Yahweh lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, Yahweh’s anointed. Now see where the king’s spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head.”\n",
      "Saul knew David’s voice, and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.”\n",
      "He said, “Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?\n",
      "Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is so that Yahweh has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering. But if it is the children of men, they are cursed before Yahweh; for they have driven me out this day that I shouldn’t cling to Yahweh’s inheritance, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods!’\n",
      "Now therefore, don’t let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”\n",
      "Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.”\n",
      "David answered, “Behold the spear, O king! Then let one of the young men come over and get it.\n",
      "Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn’t stretch out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed.\n",
      "Behold, as your life was respected this day in my eyes, so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yahweh, and let him deliver me out of all oppression.”\n",
      "Then Saul said to David, “You are blessed, my son David. You shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail.” So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.\n",
      "David said in his heart, “I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel. So shall I escape out of his hand.”\n",
      "David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.\n",
      "David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.\n",
      "It was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.\n",
      "David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?”\n",
      "Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.\n",
      "The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.\n",
      "David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.\n",
      "David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the cattle, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned, and came to Achish.\n",
      "Achish said, “Against whom have you made a raid today?” David said, “Against the South of Judah, against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.”\n",
      "David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, “Lest they should tell of us, saying, ‘David this, and this has been his way all the time he has lived in the country of the Philistines.’”\n",
      "Achish believed David, saying, “He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him. Therefore he shall be my servant forever.”\n",
      "In those days, the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. Achish said to David, “Know assuredly that you shall go out with me in the army, you and your men.”\n",
      "David said to Achish, “Therefore you shall know what your servant will do.” Achish said to David, “Therefore will I make you my bodyguard for ever.”\n",
      "Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.\n",
      "The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.\n",
      "When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.\n",
      "When Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn’t answer him, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.\n",
      "Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.” His servants said to him, “Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at Endor.”\n",
      "Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, “Please divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomever I shall name to you.”\n",
      "The woman said to him, “Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?”\n",
      "Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, “As Yahweh lives, no punishment shall happen to you for this thing.”\n",
      "Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up to you?” He said, “Bring Samuel up for me.”\n",
      "When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!”\n",
      "The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid. For what do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.”\n",
      "He said to her, “What does he look like?” She said, “An old man comes up. He is covered with a robe.” Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and showed respect.\n",
      "Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?” Saul answered, “I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.”\n",
      "Samuel said, “Why then do you ask of me, since Yahweh has departed from you and has become your adversary?\n",
      "Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me. Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David.\n",
      "Because you didn’t obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn’t execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day.\n",
      "Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.”\n",
      "Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was terrified, because of the words of Samuel. There was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.\n",
      "The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, “Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.\n",
      "Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.”\n",
      "But he refused, and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.\n",
      "The woman had a fattened calf in the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.\n",
      "She brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.\n",
      "Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel.\n",
      "The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish.\n",
      "Then the princes of the Philistines said, “What about these Hebrews?” Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, “Isn’t this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away to this day?”\n",
      "But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, “Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For with what should this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Should it not be with the heads of these men?\n",
      "Is not this David, of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying, ‘Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?’”\n",
      "Then Achish called David, and said to him, “As Yahweh lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, the lords don’t favor you.\n",
      "Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease the lords of the Philistines.”\n",
      "David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”\n",
      "Achish answered David, “I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God. Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.’\n",
      "Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.”\n",
      "So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel.\n",
      "When David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the South, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,\n",
      "and had taken captive the women and all who were therein, both small and great. They didn’t kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.\n",
      "When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.\n",
      "Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.\n",
      "David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.\n",
      "David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.\n",
      "David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring me here the ephod.” Abiathar brought the ephod to David.\n",
      "David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them?” He answered him, “Pursue; for you shall surely overtake them, and shall without fail recover all.”\n",
      "So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.\n",
      "But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn’t go over the brook Besor.\n",
      "They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.\n",
      "They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.\n",
      "David asked him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?” He said, “I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.\n",
      "We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.”\n",
      "David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this troop?” He said, “Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.”\n",
      "When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great plunder that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.\n",
      "David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.\n",
      "David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.\n",
      "There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither plunder, nor anything that they had taken to them. David brought back all.\n",
      "David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, “This is David’s plunder.”\n",
      "David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to the people, he greeted them.\n",
      "Then all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, “Because they didn’t go with us, we will not give them anything of the plunder that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.”\n",
      "Then David said, “You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.\n",
      "Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share alike.”\n",
      "It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.\n",
      "When David came to Ziklag, he sent of the plunder to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, “Behold, a present for you of the plunder of the enemies of Yahweh.”\n",
      "He sent it to those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,\n",
      "and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,\n",
      "and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,\n",
      "and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Borashan, and to those who were in Athach,\n",
      "and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay.\n",
      "Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.\n",
      "The Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.\n",
      "The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.\n",
      "Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me!” But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.\n",
      "When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him.\n",
      "So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.\n",
      "When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.\n",
      "On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.\n",
      "They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people.\n",
      "They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.\n",
      "When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,\n",
      "all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.\n",
      "They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.\n",
      "After the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag;\n",
      "on the third day, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and showed respect.\n",
      "David said to him, “Where do you come from?” He said to him, “I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.”\n",
      "David said to him, “How did it go? Please tell me.” He answered, “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.”\n",
      "David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”\n",
      "The young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.\n",
      "When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, ‘Here I am.’\n",
      "He said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’\n",
      "He said to me, ‘Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.’\n",
      "So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.”\n",
      "Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him.\n",
      "They mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.\n",
      "David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?” He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”\n",
      "David said to him, “How were you not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Yahweh’s anointed?”\n",
      "David called one of the young men, and said, “Go near, and fall on him.” He struck him, so that he died.\n",
      "David said to him, “Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have slain Yahweh’s anointed.’”\n",
      "David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son\n",
      "(and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):\n",
      "“Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!\n",
      "Don’t tell it in Gath. Don’t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\n",
      "You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings; For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.\n",
      "From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, Jonathan’s bow didn’t turn back. Saul’s sword didn’t return empty.\n",
      "Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives. In their death, they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles. They were stronger than lions.\n",
      "You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.\n",
      "How are the mighty fallen in the middle of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.\n",
      "I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.\n",
      "How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!”\n",
      "Ofter this, David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?” Yahweh said to him, “Go up.” David said, “Where shall I go up?” He said, “To Hebron.”\n",
      "So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.\n",
      "David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household. They lived in the cities of Hebron.\n",
      "The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, saying, “The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.”\n",
      "David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “Blessed are you by Yahweh, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.\n",
      "Now may Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you. I also will reward you for this kindness, because you have done this thing.\n",
      "Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.”\n",
      "Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;\n",
      "and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.\n",
      "Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.\n",
      "The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.\n",
      "Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.\n",
      "Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.\n",
      "Abner said to Joab, “Please let the young men arise and play before us!” Joab said, “Let them arise!”\n",
      "Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.\n",
      "They each caught his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.\n",
      "The battle was very severe that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.\n",
      "The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.\n",
      "Asahel pursued Abner; and in going he didn’t turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.\n",
      "Then Abner looked behind him, and said, “Is it you, Asahel?” He answered, “It is I.”\n",
      "Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armor.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.\n",
      "Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?”\n",
      "However he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. As many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.\n",
      "But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.\n",
      "The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.\n",
      "Then Abner called to Joab, and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Don’t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?”\n",
      "Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone away, and not each followed his brother.”\n",
      "So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued Israel no more, neither fought they any more.\n",
      "Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.\n",
      "Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.\n",
      "But the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men, so that three hundred sixty men died.\n",
      "They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.\n",
      "Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.\n",
      "To David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;\n",
      "and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;\n",
      "and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;\n",
      "and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.\n",
      "While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.\n",
      "Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”\n",
      "Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman!\n",
      "God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn to David, I don’t do even so to him;\n",
      "to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.”\n",
      "He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.\n",
      "Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, “Whose is the land?” and saying, “Make your alliance with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring all Israel around to you.”\n",
      "He said, “Good; I will make a treaty with you; but one thing I require of you. That is, you shall not see my face, unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.”\n",
      "David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”\n",
      "Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.\n",
      "Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go! Return!” and he returned.\n",
      "Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times past, you sought for David to be king over you.\n",
      "Now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.’”\n",
      "Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.\n",
      "So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.\n",
      "Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.” David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.\n",
      "Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great plunder with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.\n",
      "When Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.\n",
      "Then Joab came to the king, and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?\n",
      "You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.”\n",
      "When Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David didn’t know it.\n",
      "When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.\n",
      "Afterward, when David heard it, he said, “I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.\n",
      "Let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house. Let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.”\n",
      "So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.\n",
      "David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, and clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. King David followed the bier.\n",
      "They buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.\n",
      "The king lamented for Abner, and said, “Should Abner die as a fool dies?\n",
      "Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.” All the people wept again over him.\n",
      "All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun goes down.”\n",
      "All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people.\n",
      "So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.\n",
      "The king said to his servants, “Don’t you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?\n",
      "I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May Yahweh reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.”\n",
      "When Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.\n",
      "Saul’s son had two men who were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:\n",
      "and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until this day).\n",
      "Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and as she made haste to flee, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.\n",
      "The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon.\n",
      "They came there into the middle of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.\n",
      "Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.\n",
      "They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life! Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his offspring.”\n",
      "David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,\n",
      "when someone told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead, ’ thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.\n",
      "How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?”\n",
      "David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.\n",
      "Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.\n",
      "In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.’”\n",
      "So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel.\n",
      "David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.\n",
      "In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.\n",
      "The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “Unless you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here”; thinking, “David can’t come in here.”\n",
      "Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.\n",
      "David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and strike the lame and the blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.”\n",
      "David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. David built around from Millo and inward.\n",
      "David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with him.\n",
      "Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.\n",
      "David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.\n",
      "David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.\n",
      "These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,\n",
      "and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,\n",
      "and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.\n",
      "When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.\n",
      "Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.\n",
      "David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?” Yahweh said to David, “Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.”\n",
      "David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, “Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.\n",
      "They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.\n",
      "The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.\n",
      "When David inquired of Yahweh, he said, “You shall not go up. Circle around behind them, and attack them over against the mulberry trees.\n",
      "It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall stir yourself up; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”\n",
      "David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.\n",
      "David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.\n",
      "David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Armies who sits above the cherubim.\n",
      "They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.\n",
      "They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.\n",
      "David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all kinds of instruments made of fir wood, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with castanets, and with cymbals.\n",
      "When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached for the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled.\n",
      "Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.\n",
      "David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken out against Uzzah; and he called that place Perez Uzzah, to this day.\n",
      "David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, “How shall Yahweh’s ark come to me?”\n",
      "So David would not move Yahweh’s ark to be with him in the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.\n",
      "Yahweh’s ark remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months: and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom, and all his house.\n",
      "It was told king David, saying, “Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God.” David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy.\n",
      "It was so, that, when those who bore Yahweh’s ark had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.\n",
      "David danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was clothed in a linen ephod.\n",
      "So David and all the house of Israel brought up Yahweh’s ark with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.\n",
      "It was so, as Yahweh’s ark came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh; and she despised him in her heart.\n",
      "They brought in Yahweh’s ark, and set it in its place, in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.\n",
      "When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies.\n",
      "He gave to all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a portion of bread, dates, and raisins. So all the people departed everyone to his house.\n",
      "Then David returned to bless his household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How glorious the king of Israel was today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!”\n",
      "David said to Michal, “It was before Yahweh, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. Therefore will I celebrate before Yahweh.\n",
      "I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my own sight. But of the handmaids of whom you have spoken, they shall honor me.”\n",
      "Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.\n",
      "When the king lived in his house, and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around,\n",
      "the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.”\n",
      "Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.”\n",
      "That same night, Yahweh’s word came to Nathan, saying,\n",
      "“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh says, “Shall you build me a house for me to dwell in?\n",
      "For I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.\n",
      "In all places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel, did I say a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’\n",
      "Now therefore you shall tell my servant David this, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people, over Israel.\n",
      "I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.\n",
      "I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,\n",
      "and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.\n",
      "When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your offspring after you, who shall proceed out of your body, and I will establish his kingdom.\n",
      "He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.\n",
      "I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;\n",
      "but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.\n",
      "Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.”’”\n",
      "According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.\n",
      "Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Lord Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?\n",
      "This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your servant’s house for a great while to come; and this after the way of men, Lord Yahweh!\n",
      "What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord Yahweh.\n",
      "For your word’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.\n",
      "Therefore you are great, Yahweh God. For there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.\n",
      "What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?\n",
      "You established for yourself your people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.\n",
      "Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as you have spoken.\n",
      "Let your name be magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is God over Israel; and the house of your servant David shall be established before you.’\n",
      "For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house.’ Therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.\n",
      "“Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.\n",
      "Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord Yahweh, have spoken it. Let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing.”\n",
      "After this, David struck the Philistines, and subdued them; and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "He struck Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. The Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.\n",
      "David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River.\n",
      "David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.\n",
      "When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.\n",
      "Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.\n",
      "David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.\n",
      "From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.\n",
      "When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer,\n",
      "then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:\n",
      "King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;\n",
      "of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the plunder of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.\n",
      "David earned a reputation when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.\n",
      "He put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.\n",
      "David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness to all his people.\n",
      "Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;\n",
      "and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;\n",
      "and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.\n",
      "David said, “Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”\n",
      "There was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” He said, “Your servant is he.”\n",
      "The king said, “Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him?” Ziba said to the king, “Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his feet.”\n",
      "The king said to him, “Where is he?” Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.”\n",
      "Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.\n",
      "Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and showed respect. David said, “Mephibosheth.” He answered, “Behold, your servant!”\n",
      "David said to him, “Don’t be afraid of him; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father. You shall eat bread at my table continually.”\n",
      "He bowed down, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?”\n",
      "Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master’s son.\n",
      "You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons, and your servants; and you shall bring in the harvest, that your master’s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth your master’s son shall eat bread always at my table.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.\n",
      "Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your servant shall do.” So Mephibosheth ate at the king’s table, like one of the king’s sons.\n",
      "Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.\n",
      "So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king’s table. He was lame in both his feet.\n",
      "After this, the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn’t David sent his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?”\n",
      "So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.\n",
      "When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”\n",
      "When the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.\n",
      "When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.\n",
      "The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.\n",
      "Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:\n",
      "The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.\n",
      "He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.\n",
      "Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and Yahweh do that which seems good to him.”\n",
      "So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.\n",
      "When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.\n",
      "When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.\n",
      "Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head.\n",
      "It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.\n",
      "The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians seven hundred charioteers, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that he died there.\n",
      "When all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.\n",
      "At the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem.\n",
      "At evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look at.\n",
      "David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”\n",
      "David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.\n",
      "The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, “I am with child.”\n",
      "David sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” Joab sent Uriah to David.\n",
      "When Uriah had come to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.\n",
      "David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.\n",
      "But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn’t go down to his house.\n",
      "When they had told David, saying, “Uriah didn’t go down to his house, ” David said to Uriah, “Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go down to your house?”\n",
      "Uriah said to David, “The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!”\n",
      "David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.\n",
      "When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn’t go down to his house.\n",
      "In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.\n",
      "He wrote in the letter, saying, “Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.”\n",
      "When Joab kept watch on the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.\n",
      "The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.\n",
      "Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;\n",
      "and he commanded the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,\n",
      "it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he asks you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they would shoot from the wall?\n",
      "who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’”\n",
      "So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.\n",
      "The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.\n",
      "The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.”\n",
      "Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.’ Encourage him.”\n",
      "When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.\n",
      "When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.\n",
      "The rich man had very many flocks and herds,\n",
      "but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter.\n",
      "A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to him.”\n",
      "David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die!\n",
      "He shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!”\n",
      "Nathan said to David, “You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.\n",
      "I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.\n",
      "Why have you despised Yahweh’s word, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’\n",
      "“This is what Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.\n",
      "For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’”\n",
      "David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against Yahweh.” Nathan said to David, “Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will not die.\n",
      "However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh’s enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die.”\n",
      "Nathan departed to his house. Yahweh struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it was very sick.\n",
      "David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.\n",
      "The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.\n",
      "On the seventh day, the child died. The servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn’t listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?”\n",
      "But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” They said, “He is dead.”\n",
      "Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into Yahweh’s house, and worshiped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.\n",
      "Then his servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread.”\n",
      "He said, “While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?’\n",
      "But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.”\n",
      "David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Yahweh loved him;\n",
      "and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named him Jedidiah, for Yahweh’s sake.\n",
      "Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.\n",
      "Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters.\n",
      "Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.”\n",
      "David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.\n",
      "He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. He brought out the plunder of the city, exceeding much.\n",
      "He brought out the people who were therein, and put them under saws, and under iron picks, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln: and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.\n",
      "After this, Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.\n",
      "Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.\n",
      "But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.\n",
      "He said to him, “Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won’t you tell me?” Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”\n",
      "Jonadab said to him, “Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.’”\n",
      "So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”\n",
      "Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”\n",
      "So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.\n",
      "She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, “Have all men leave me.” Every man went out from him.\n",
      "Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.” Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.\n",
      "When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister!”\n",
      "She answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don’t you do this folly.\n",
      "I, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.”\n",
      "However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.\n",
      "Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone!”\n",
      "She said to him, “Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!” But he would not listen to her.\n",
      "Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, “Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.”\n",
      "She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters who were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.\n",
      "Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.\n",
      "Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.” So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.\n",
      "But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.\n",
      "Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.\n",
      "After two full years, Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.\n",
      "Absalom came to the king, and said, “See now, your servant has sheep shearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.”\n",
      "The king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.” He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him.\n",
      "Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” The king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”\n",
      "But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.\n",
      "Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “Mark now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, ‘Strike Amnon, ’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!”\n",
      "The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled.\n",
      "While they were on the way, the news came to David, saying, “Absalom has slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left!”\n",
      "Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.\n",
      "Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered, “Don’t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.\n",
      "Now therefore don’t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.”\n",
      "But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.\n",
      "Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.”\n",
      "As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly.\n",
      "But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.\n",
      "So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.\n",
      "King David longed to go out to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.\n",
      "Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.\n",
      "Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise woman, and said to her, “Please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, please, and don’t anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead.\n",
      "Go in to the king, and speak like this to him.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.\n",
      "When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said, “Help, O king!”\n",
      "The king said to her, “What ails you?” She answered, “Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.\n",
      "Your handmaid had two sons, and they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him.\n",
      "Behold, the whole family has risen against your handmaid, and they say, ‘Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.’ Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth.”\n",
      "The king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.”\n",
      "The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.”\n",
      "The king said, “Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more.”\n",
      "Then she said, “Please let the king remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.” He said, “As Yahweh lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth.”\n",
      "Then the woman said, “Please let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king.” He said, “Say on.”\n",
      "The woman said, “Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one.\n",
      "For we must die, and are like water split on the ground, which can’t be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him.\n",
      "Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, ‘I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.’\n",
      "For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.\n",
      "Then your handmaid said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. May Yahweh, your God, be with you.’”\n",
      "Then the king answered the woman, “Please don’t hide anything from me that I ask you.” The woman said, “Let my lord the king now speak.”\n",
      "The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” The woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab, he urged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid;\n",
      "to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing. My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.”\n",
      "The king said to Joab, “Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.”\n",
      "Joab fell to the ground on his face, showed respect, and blessed the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.”\n",
      "So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.\n",
      "The king said, “Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, and didn’t see the king’s face.\n",
      "Now in all Israel there was no one to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no defect in him.\n",
      "When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight.\n",
      "To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a beautiful face.\n",
      "Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn’t see the king’s face.\n",
      "Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.\n",
      "Therefore he said to his servants, “Behold, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.\n",
      "Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”\n",
      "Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.”’”\n",
      "So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.\n",
      "After this, Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.\n",
      "Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. It was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, “What city are you from?” He said, “Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.”\n",
      "Absalom said to him, “Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you.”\n",
      "Absalom said moreover, “Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!”\n",
      "It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.\n",
      "Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.\n",
      "At the end of forty years, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.\n",
      "For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.’”\n",
      "The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose, and went to Hebron.\n",
      "But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’”\n",
      "Two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn’t know anything.\n",
      "Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.\n",
      "A messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.”\n",
      "David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom. Make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”\n",
      "The king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses.”\n",
      "The king went out, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.\n",
      "The king went out, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak.\n",
      "All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.\n",
      "Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to your own place.\n",
      "Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us, since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you.”\n",
      "Ittai answered the king, and said, “As Yahweh lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will your servant be.”\n",
      "David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him.\n",
      "All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.\n",
      "Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people finished passing out of the city.\n",
      "The king said to Zadok, “Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation;\n",
      "but if he say thus, ‘I have no delight in you; ’ behold, here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to him.”\n",
      "The king said also to Zadok the priest, “Aren’t you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.\n",
      "Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me.”\n",
      "Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem; and they stayed there.\n",
      "David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.\n",
      "Someone told David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” David said, “Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.”\n",
      "When David had come to the top, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head.\n",
      "David said to him, “If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me;\n",
      "but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father’s servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.’\n",
      "Don’t you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? Therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king’s house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.\n",
      "Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear.”\n",
      "So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.\n",
      "When David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.\n",
      "The king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.\n",
      "The king said, “Where is your master’s son?” Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem; for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father.’”\n",
      "Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours.” Ziba said, “I do obeisance. Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.”\n",
      "When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, and cursed still as he came.\n",
      "He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.\n",
      "Shimei said when he cursed, “Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow!\n",
      "Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned! Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!”\n",
      "Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.”\n",
      "The king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, ‘Curse David; ’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’”\n",
      "David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, “Behold, my son, who came out of my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.\n",
      "It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today.”\n",
      "So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust.\n",
      "The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.\n",
      "Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.\n",
      "When Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, had come to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”\n",
      "Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?”\n",
      "Hushai said to Absalom, “No; but whomever Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will stay.\n",
      "Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn’t I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so will I be in your presence.”\n",
      "Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel what we shall do.”\n",
      "Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines, that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.”\n",
      "So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.\n",
      "The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.\n",
      "Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight.\n",
      "I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him shall flee. I will strike the king only;\n",
      "and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace.”\n",
      "The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.\n",
      "Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.”\n",
      "When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up.”\n",
      "Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.”\n",
      "Hushai said moreover, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.\n",
      "Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!’\n",
      "Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.\n",
      "But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.\n",
      "So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.\n",
      "Moreover, if he be gone into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn’t one small stone found there.”\n",
      "Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.\n",
      "Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way.\n",
      "Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, ‘Don’t lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.’”\n",
      "Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David. For they might not be seen to come into the city.\n",
      "But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.\n",
      "The woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and spread out bruised grain on it; and nothing was known.\n",
      "Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” The woman said to them, “They have gone over the brook of water.” When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.\n",
      "After they had departed, they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, “Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.”\n",
      "Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.\n",
      "When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.\n",
      "Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.\n",
      "Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.\n",
      "Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.\n",
      "When David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,\n",
      "brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted grain,\n",
      "honey, butter, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat: for they said, “The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.”\n",
      "David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.\n",
      "David sent the people out, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, “I will also surely go out with you myself.”\n",
      "But the people said, “You shall not go out; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.”\n",
      "The king said to them, “I will do what seems best to you.” The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.\n",
      "The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.” All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.\n",
      "So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.\n",
      "The people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.\n",
      "For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.\n",
      "Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.\n",
      "A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”\n",
      "Joab said to the man who told him, “Behold, you saw it, and why didn’t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash.”\n",
      "The man said to Joab, “Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.’\n",
      "Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me.”\n",
      "Then Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this with you.” He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak.\n",
      "Ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him.\n",
      "Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.\n",
      "They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled everyone to his tent.\n",
      "Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king’s dale; for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in memory.” He called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom’s monument, to this day.\n",
      "Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.”\n",
      "Joab said to him, “You shall not be the bearer of news this day, but you shall bear news another day. But today you shall bear no news, because the king’s son is dead.”\n",
      "Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen!” The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.\n",
      "Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, “But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.” Joab said, “Why do you want to run, my son, since that you will have no reward for the news?”\n",
      "“But come what may, ” he said, “I will run.” He said to him, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.\n",
      "Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.\n",
      "The watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” He came closer and closer.\n",
      "The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the porter, and said, “Behold, a man running alone!” The king said, “He also brings news.”\n",
      "The watchman said, “I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” The king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.”\n",
      "Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, “All is well.” He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, “Blessed is Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king!”\n",
      "The king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don’t know what it was.”\n",
      "The king said, “Turn aside, and stand here.” He turned aside, and stood still.\n",
      "Behold, the Cushite came. The Cushite said, “News for my lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you.”\n",
      "The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” The Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is.”\n",
      "The king was much moved, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he said, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!”\n",
      "It was told Joab, “Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.”\n",
      "The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard it said that day, “The king grieves for his son.”\n",
      "The people sneaked into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.\n",
      "The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, “My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!”\n",
      "Joab came into the house to the king, and said, “You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;\n",
      "in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared this day, that princes and servants are nothing to you. For today I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it would have pleased you well.\n",
      "Now therefore arise, go out, and speak to comfort your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don’t go out, not a man will stay with you this night. That would be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now.”\n",
      "Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” All the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.\n",
      "All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.\n",
      "Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don’t you speak a word of bringing the king back?”\n",
      "King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house.\n",
      "You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’\n",
      "Say to Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren’t captain of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.’”\n",
      "He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, “Return, you and all your servants.”\n",
      "So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.\n",
      "Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.\n",
      "There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.\n",
      "A ferry boat went to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he had come over the Jordan.\n",
      "He said to the king, “Don’t let my lord impute iniquity to me, nor remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.\n",
      "For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore behold, I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.”\n",
      "But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, “Shall Shimei not be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh’s anointed?”\n",
      "David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries to me? Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? For don’t I know that I am this day king over Israel?”\n",
      "The king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” The king swore to him.\n",
      "Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.\n",
      "When he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”\n",
      "He answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride on it, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.\n",
      "He has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God. Do therefore what is good in your eyes.\n",
      "For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?”\n",
      "The king said to him, “Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Ziba divide the land.”\n",
      "Mephibosheth said to the king, “Yes, let him take all, because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house.”\n",
      "Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.\n",
      "Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.\n",
      "The king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.”\n",
      "Barzillai said to the king, “How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?\n",
      "I am this day eighty years old. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?\n",
      "Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?\n",
      "Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.”\n",
      "The king answered, “Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you. Whatever you require of me, that I will do for you.”\n",
      "All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. Then the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.\n",
      "So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him. All the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.\n",
      "Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, “Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?”\n",
      "All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? Or has he given us any gift?”\n",
      "The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, “We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more claim to David than you. Why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?” The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.\n",
      "There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, “We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, Israel!”\n",
      "So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.\n",
      "David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but didn’t go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.\n",
      "Then the king said to Amasa, “Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here present.”\n",
      "So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.\n",
      "David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.”\n",
      "There went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.\n",
      "When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went along it fell out.\n",
      "Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.\n",
      "But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand. So he struck him with it in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn’t strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.\n",
      "There stood by him one of Joab’s young men, and said, “He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab!”\n",
      "Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.\n",
      "When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.\n",
      "He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.\n",
      "They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.\n",
      "Then a wise woman cried out of the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come near here, that I may speak with you.’”\n",
      "He came near to her; and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your handmaid.” He answered, “I do hear.”\n",
      "Then she spoke, saying, “They were used to say in old times, ‘They shall surely ask counsel at Abel; ’ and so they settled it.\n",
      "I am among those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?”\n",
      "Joab answered, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.\n",
      "The matter is not so. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.” The woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.”\n",
      "Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.\n",
      "Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;\n",
      "and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;\n",
      "and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;\n",
      "and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.\n",
      "There was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh. Yahweh said, “It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.”\n",
      "The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them: and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);\n",
      "and David said to the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh?”\n",
      "The Gibeonites said to him, “It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” He said, “Whatever you say, that will I do for you.”\n",
      "They said to the king, “The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,\n",
      "let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.” The king said, “I will give them.”\n",
      "But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Yahweh’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.\n",
      "But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.\n",
      "He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and all seven of them fell together. They were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.\n",
      "Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured on them from the sky. She allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night.\n",
      "It was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.\n",
      "David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa;\n",
      "and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.\n",
      "They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. After that God was entreated for the land.\n",
      "The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. David grew faint;\n",
      "and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being armed with a new sword, thought to have slain David.\n",
      "But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you don’t quench the lamp of Israel.”\n",
      "It came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.\n",
      "There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite’s brother, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.\n",
      "There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.\n",
      "When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, killed him.\n",
      "These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.\n",
      "David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:\n",
      "and he said, “Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;\n",
      "God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge. My savior, you save me from violence.\n",
      "I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from my enemies.\n",
      "For the waves of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.\n",
      "The cords of Sheol were around me. The snares of death caught me.\n",
      "In my distress I called on Yahweh. Yes, I called to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple. My cry came into his ears.\n",
      "Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.\n",
      "Smoke went up out of his nostrils. Fire out of his mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it.\n",
      "He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet.\n",
      "He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.\n",
      "He made darkness pavilions around himself: gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies.\n",
      "At the brightness before him, coals of fire were kindled.\n",
      "Yahweh thundered from heaven. The Most High uttered his voice.\n",
      "He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them.\n",
      "Then the channels of the sea appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.\n",
      "He sent from on high and he took me. He drew me out of many waters.\n",
      "He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.\n",
      "They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh was my support.\n",
      "He also brought me out into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.\n",
      "Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness. He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.\n",
      "For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly departed from my God.\n",
      "For all his ordinances were before me. As for his statutes, I did not depart from them.\n",
      "I was also perfect toward him. I kept myself from my iniquity.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.\n",
      "With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect.\n",
      "With the pure you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.\n",
      "You will save the afflicted people, But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.\n",
      "For you are my lamp, Yahweh. Yahweh will light up my darkness.\n",
      "For by you, I run against a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.\n",
      "As for God, his way is perfect. Yahweh’s word is tested. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.\n",
      "For who is God, besides Yahweh? Who is a rock, besides our God?\n",
      "God is my strong fortress. He makes my way perfect.\n",
      "He makes his feet like hinds’ feet, and sets me on my high places.\n",
      "He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.\n",
      "You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your gentleness has made me great.\n",
      "You have enlarged my steps under me. My feet have not slipped.\n",
      "I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them. I didn’t turn again until they were consumed.\n",
      "I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they can’t arise. Yes, they have fallen under my feet.\n",
      "For you have armed me with strength for the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.\n",
      "You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.\n",
      "They looked, but there was no one to save; even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.\n",
      "Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth. I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.\n",
      "You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people. You have kept me to be the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known will serve me.\n",
      "The foreigners will submit themselves to me. As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.\n",
      "The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out of their close places.\n",
      "Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock! Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,\n",
      "even the God who executes vengeance for me, who brings down peoples under me,\n",
      "who brings me away from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man.\n",
      "Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations, and will sing praises to your name.\n",
      "He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his offspring, forever more.”\n",
      "Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse says, the man who was raised on high says, the anointed of the God of Jacob, the sweet psalmist of Israel:\n",
      "“Yahweh’s Spirit spoke by me. His word was on my tongue.\n",
      "The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, ‘One who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God,\n",

      "Most certainly my house is not so with God, yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure, for it is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he doesn’t make it grow.\n",
      "But all the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away, because they can’t be taken with the hand,\n",
      "But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear. They shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.”\n",
      "These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.\n",
      "After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.\n",
      "He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take plunder.\n",
      "After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.\n",
      "But he stood in the middle of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.\n",
      "Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.\n",
      "David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.\n",
      "David longed, and said, “Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”\n",
      "The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.\n",
      "He said, “Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this! Isn’t it the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.\n",
      "Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.\n",

      "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the middle of a pit in time of snow.\n",
      "He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.\n",
      "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.\n",
      "He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three. David set him over his guard.\n",

      "Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.\n",

      "David’s heart struck him after that he had numbered the people. David said to Yahweh, “I have sinned greatly in that which I have done. But now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.”\n",
      "When David rose up in the morning, Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,\n",
      "“Go and speak to David, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”\n",
      "So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.”\n",
      "David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are great. Let me not fall into the hand of man.”\n",
      "So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.\n",
      "When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, “It is enough. Now stay your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\n",
      "David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, “Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my father’s house.”\n",
      "Gad came that day to David, and said to him, “Go up, build an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”\n",
      "David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.\n",
      "Araunah looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. Then Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.\n",
      "Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David said, “To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”\n",
      "Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:\n",
      "all this, king, does Araunah give to the king.” Araunah said to the king, “May Yahweh your God accept you.”\n",
      "The king said to Araunah, “No; but I will most certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.\n",
      "David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.\n",
      "Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn’t keep warm.\n",
      "Therefore his servants said to him, “Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.”\n",
      "So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.\n",
      "The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king didn’t know her intimately.\n",
      "Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” Then he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.\n",
      "His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, “Why have you done so?” and he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom.\n",
      "He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.\n",
      "But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.\n",
      "Adonijah killed sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants:\n",
      "but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he didn’t call.\n",
      "Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Haven’t you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn’t know it?\n",
      "Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.\n",
      "Go in to king David, and tell him, ‘Didn’t you, my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?’\n",
      "Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.”\n",
      "Bathsheba went in to the king into the room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.\n",
      "Bathsheba bowed, and showed respect to the king. The king said, “What would you like?”\n",
      "She said to him, “My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God to your handmaid, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’\n",
      "Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, don’t know it.\n",
      "He has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn’t called Solomon your servant.\n",
      "You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.\n",
      "Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.”\n",
      "Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.\n",
      "They told the king, saying, “Behold, Nathan the prophet!” When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.\n",
      "Nathan said, “My lord, king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?’\n",
      "For he is gone down this day, and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, ‘Long live king Adonijah!’\n",
      "But he hasn’t called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.\n",
      "Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven’t shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”\n",
      "Then king David answered, “Call to me Bathsheba.” She came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.\n",
      "The king swore, and said, “As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,\n",
      "most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place; ’ most certainly so will I do this day.”\n",
      "Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and showed respect to the king, and said, “Let my lord king David live forever!”\n",
      "King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” They came before the king.\n",
      "The king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.\n",
      "Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. Blow the trumpet, and say, ‘Long live king Solomon!’\n",
      "Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.”\n",
      "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, “Amen. May Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, say so.\n",
      "As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.”\n",
      "So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.\n",
      "Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the Tent, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet; and all the people said, “Long live king Solomon!”\n",
      "All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with their sound.\n",
      "Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?”\n",
      "While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, “Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.”\n",
      "Jonathan answered Adonijah, “Most certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king.\n",
      "The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king’s mule.\n",
      "Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. They have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard.\n",
      "Also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.\n",
      "Moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne; ’ and the king bowed himself on the bed.\n",
      "Also thus said the king, ‘Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.’”\n",
      "All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way.\n",
      "Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.\n",
      "It was told Solomon, saying, “Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for, behold, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’”\n",
      "Solomon said, “If he shows himself a worthy man, not a hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.”\n",
      "So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”\n",
      "Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he commanded Solomon his son, saying,\n",
      "“I am going the way of all the earth. You be strong therefore, and show yourself a man;\n",
      "and keep the instruction of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you turn yourself.\n",
      "That Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you, ’ he said, ‘a man on the throne of Israel.’\n",
      "“Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist, and in his shoes that were on his feet.\n",
      "Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don’t let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.\n",
      "But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.\n",
      "“Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Yahweh, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’\n",
      "Now therefore don’t hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood.”\n",
      "David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.\n",
      "The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was firmly established.\n",
      "Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said, “Do you come peaceably?” He said, “Peaceably.\n",
      "He said moreover, I have something to tell you.” She said, “Say on.”\n",
      "He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. However the kingdom is turned around, and has become my brother’s; for it was his from Yahweh.\n",
      "Now I ask one petition of you. Don’t deny me.” She said to him, “Say on.”\n",
      "He said, “Please speak to Solomon the king (for he will not tell you ‘no’), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.”\n",
      "Bathsheba said, “Alright. I will speak for you to the king.”\n",
      "Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.\n",
      "Then she said, “I ask one small petition of you; don’t deny me.” The king said to her, “Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you.”\n",
      "She said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.”\n",
      "King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.”\n",
      "Then king Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.\n",
      "Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.”\n",
      "King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died.\n",
      "To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.”\n",
      "So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, that he might fulfill Yahweh’s word, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.\n",
      "The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he didn’t turn after Absalom. Joab fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.\n",
      "It was told king Solomon, “Joab has fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and behold, he is by the altar.” Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, fall on him.”\n",
      "Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh, and said to him, “Thus says the king, ‘Come out!’” He said, “No; but I will die here.” Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, “Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.”\n",
      "The king said to him, “Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house.\n",
      "Yahweh will return his blood on his own head, because he fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David didn’t know it: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.\n",
      "So shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his offspring forever. But to David, and to his offspring, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace forever from Yahweh.”\n",
      "Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.\n",
      "The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.\n",
      "The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and don’t go out from there anywhere.\n",
      "For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be on your own head.”\n",
      "Shimei said to the king, “The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.\n",
      "At the end of three years, two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, “Behold, your servants are in Gath.”\n",
      "Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.\n",
      "It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.\n",
      "The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Didn’t I adjure you by Yahweh, and warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where, you shall surely die?’ You said to me, ‘The saying that I have heard is good.’\n",
      "Why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment that I have instructed you with?”\n",
      "The king said moreover to Shimei, “You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father. Therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head.\n",
      "But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Yahweh forever.”\n",
      "So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.\n",
      "Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and Yahweh’s house, and the wall of Jerusalem all around.\n",
      "Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for Yahweh’s name until those days.\n",
      "Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.\n",
      "The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.\n",
      "In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask what I shall give you.”\n",
      "Solomon said, “You have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you. You have kept for him this great loving kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.\n",
      "Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father. I am but a little child. I don’t know how to go out or come in.\n",
      "Your servant is among your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can’t be numbered nor counted for multitude.\n",
      "Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this your great people?”\n",
      "The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.\n",
      "God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;\n",
      "behold, I have done according to your word. Behold, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there has been no one like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like you.\n",
      "I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like you, all your days.\n",
      "If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”\n",
      "Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.\n",
      "Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king, and stood before him.\n",
      "The one woman said, “Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. I delivered a child with her in the house.\n",
      "The third day after I delivered, this woman delivered also. We were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, just us two in the house.\n",
      "This woman’s child died in the night, because she lay on it.\n",
      "She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.\n",
      "When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore.”\n",
      "The other woman said, “No; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son.” This said, “No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my son.” Thus they spoke before the king.\n",
      "Then the king said, “The one says, ‘This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead; ’ and the other says, ‘No; but your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.’”\n",
      "The king said, “Get me a sword.” They brought a sword before the king.\n",
      "The king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.”\n",
      "Then the woman whose the living child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill it!” But the other said, “It shall be neither mine nor yours. Divide it.”\n",
      "Then the king answered, “Give her the living child, and in no way kill it. She is its mother.”\n",
      "All Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.\n",
      "King Solomon was king over all Israel.\n",
      "These were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;\n",
      "Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;\n",
      "and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;\n",
      "and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, the king’s friend;\n",
      "and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor.\n",
      "Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year.\n",
      "These are their names: Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;\n",
      "Ben Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan;\n",
      "Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (to him belonged Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);\n",
      "Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife);\n",
      "Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;\n",
      "Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him belonged the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);\n",
      "Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;\n",
      "Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife);\n",
      "Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;\n",
      "Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;\n",
      "Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;\n",
      "Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the land.\n",
      "Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.\n",
      "Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life.\n",
      "Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal,\n",
      "ten head of fat cattle, and twenty head of cattle out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides deer, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fattened fowl.\n",
      "For he had dominion over all on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides around him.\n",
      "Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.\n",
      "Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.\n",
      "Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon’s table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking.\n",
      "Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where the officers were, every man according to his duty.\n",
      "God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and very great understanding, even as the sand that is on the seashore.\n",
      "Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.\n",
      "For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations all around.\n",
      "He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were one thousand five.\n",
      "He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of animals, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish.\n",
      "There came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.\n",
      "Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.\n",
      "Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,\n",
      "“You know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Yahweh his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until Yahweh put them under the soles of his feet.\n",
      "But now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.\n",
      "Behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh spoke to David my father, saying, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house for my name.’\n",
      "Now therefore command that they cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon. My servants shall be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you shall say. For you know that there is not among us any who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”\n",
      "When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed is Yahweh this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.”\n",
      "Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message which you have sent to me. I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.\n",
      "My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and you shall receive them. You shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.”\n",
      "So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire.\n",
      "Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.\n",
      "Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a treaty together.\n",
      "King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.\n",
      "He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor.\n",
      "Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains;\n",
      "besides Solomon’s chief officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work.\n",
      "The king commanded, and they cut out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone.\n",
      "Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.\n",
      "In the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, he began to build Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "The house which king Solomon built for Yahweh, its length was sixty cubits, and its breadth twenty, and its height thirty cubits.\n",
      "The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was its length, according to the breadth of the house. Ten cubits was its breadth before the house.\n",
      "For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work.\n",
      "Against the wall of the house he built stories all around, against the walls of the house all around, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side rooms all around.\n",
      "The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.\n",
      "The house, when it was in building, was built of stone prepared at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.\n",
      "The door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third.\n",
      "So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.\n",
      "He built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came to Solomon, saying,\n",
      "“Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.\n",
      "I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.”\n",
      "So Solomon built the house, and finished it.\n",
      "He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.\n",
      "He built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling: he built them for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.\n",
      "In front of the temple sanctuary was forty cubits.\n",
      "There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.\n",
      "He prepared an oracle in the middle of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.\n",
      "Within the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in its height; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.\n",
      "So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.\n",
      "The whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.\n",
      "In the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.\n",
      "Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.\n",
      "The other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.\n",
      "The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.\n",
      "He set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched out, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the middle of the house.\n",
      "He overlaid the cherubim with gold.\n",
      "He carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, inside and outside.\n",
      "The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.\n",
      "For the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood: the lintel and door posts were a fifth part of the wall.\n",
      "So he made two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.\n",
      "So also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part of the wall;\n",
      "and two doors of fir wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.\n",
      "He carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work.\n",
      "He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams.\n",
      "In the fourth year was the foundation of Yahweh’s house laid, in the month Ziv.\n",
      "In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all its fashion. So was he seven years in building it.\n",
      "Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.\n",
      "For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.\n",
      "It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.\n",
      "There were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.\n",
      "All the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.\n",
      "He made the porch of pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.\n",
      "He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.\n",
      "His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch.\n",
      "All these were of costly stones, even of cut stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court.\n",
      "The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.\n",
      "Above were costly stones, even cut stone, according to measure, and cedar wood.\n",
      "The great court around had three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of Yahweh’s house, and the porch of the house.\n",
      "King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.\n",
      "He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work.\n",
      "For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them about.\n",
      "He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.\n",
      "There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.\n",
      "So he made the pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and he did so for the other capital.\n",
      "The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits.\n",
      "There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows around on the other capital.\n",
      "He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz.\n",
      "On the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.\n",
      "He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it.\n",
      "Under its brim around there were buds which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea: the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.\n",
      "It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.\n",
      "It was a hand breadth thick: and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.\n",
      "He made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height.\n",
      "The work of the bases was like this: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;\n",
      "and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.\n",
      "Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet of it had supports: beneath the basin were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each.\n",
      "The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth were engravings, and their panels were square, not round.\n",
      "The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.\n",
      "The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.\n",
      "There were four supports at the four corners of each base: its supports were of the base itself.\n",
      "In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same.\n",
      "On the plates of its stays, and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.\n",
      "In this way, he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.\n",
      "He made ten basins of brass: one basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on every one of the ten bases one basin.\n",
      "He set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.\n",
      "Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in Yahweh’s house:\n",
      "the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;\n",
      "and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;\n",
      "and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;\n",
      "and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;\n",
      "and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in Yahweh’s house, were of burnished brass.\n",
      "The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.\n",
      "Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.\n",
      "Solomon made all the vessels that were in Yahweh’s house: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the show bread was, of gold;\n",
      "and the lamp stands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;\n",
      "and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold.\n",
      "Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in Yahweh’s house was finished. Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion.\n",
      "All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.\n",
      "All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.\n",
      "They brought up Yahweh’s ark, and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these the priests and the Levites brought up.\n",
      "King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.\n",
      "The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.\n",
      "For the cherubim spread their wings out over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above.\n",
      "The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there they are to this day.\n",
      "There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "It came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled Yahweh’s house,\n",
      "so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.\n",
      "I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.”\n",
      "The king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.\n",
      "He said, “Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David your father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,\n",
      "‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.’\n",
      "“Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "But Yahweh said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.\n",
      "Nevertheless, you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.’\n",
      "Yahweh has established his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "There I have set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.”\n",
      "Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven;\n",
      "and he said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;\n",
      "who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.\n",
      "Now therefore, may Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.’\n",
      "“Now therefore, God of Israel, please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father.\n",
      "But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain you; how much less this house that I have built!\n",
      "Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and for his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day;\n",
      "that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, ‘My name shall be there; ’ to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place.\n",
      "Listen to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place. Yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.\n",
      "“If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swear before your altar in this house;\n",
      "then hear in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.\n",
      "“When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; if they turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you in this house:\n",
      "then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers.\n",
      "“When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:\n",
      "then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.\n",
      "“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight, mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there is;\n",
      "whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall each know the plague of his own heart, and spread out his hands toward this house:\n",
      "then hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men; )\n",
      "that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.\n",
      "“Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for your name’s sake\n",
      "(for they shall hear of your great name, and of your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray toward this house;\n",
      "hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.\n",
      "“If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name;\n",
      "then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.\n",
      "If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn’t sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near;\n",
      "yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive, saying, ‘We have sinned, and have done perversely; we have dealt wickedly; ’\n",
      "if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name:\n",
      "then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven, your dwelling place, and maintain their cause;\n",
      "and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them\n",
      "(for they are your people, and your inheritance, which you brought out of Egypt, from the middle of the furnace of iron);\n",
      "that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you.\n",
      "For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke by Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord Yahweh.”\n",
      "It was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh, he arose from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread out toward heaven.\n",
      "He stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,\n",
      "“Blessed be Yahweh, who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. There has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant.\n",
      "May Yahweh our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. Let him not leave us, nor forsake us;\n",
      "that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.\n",
      "Let these my words, with which I have made supplication before Yahweh, be near to Yahweh our God day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require;\n",
      "that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God. There is no one else.\n",
      "“Let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.”\n",
      "The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.\n",
      "Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand head of cattle, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "The same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before Yahweh’s house; for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.\n",
      "So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.\n",
      "On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant, and to Israel his people.\n",
      "When Solomon had finished the building of Yahweh’s house, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,\n",
      "Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.\n",
      "Yahweh said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me. I have made this house holy, which you have built, to put my name there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.\n",
      "As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances;\n",
      "then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, according as I promised to David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.’\n",
      "But if you turn away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;\n",
      "then I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.\n",
      "Though this house is so high, yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, ‘Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?’\n",
      "and they shall answer, ‘Because they abandoned Yahweh their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold of other gods, and worshiped them, and served them. Therefore Yahweh has brought all this evil on them.’”\n",
      "At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, Yahweh’s house and the king’s house\n",
      "(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.\n",
      "Hiram came out of Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they didn’t please him.\n",
      "He said, “What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?” He called them the land of Cabul to this day.\n",
      "Hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold.\n",
      "This is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build Yahweh’s house, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.\n",
      "Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.\n",
      "Solomon built Gezer, and Beth Horon the lower,\n",
      "and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,\n",
      "and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.\n",
      "As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;\n",
      "their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day.\n",
      "But of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.\n",
      "These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work, five hundred fifty, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work.\n",
      "But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then he built Millo.\n",
      "Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to Yahweh three times a year, burning incense with them, on the altar that was before Yahweh. So he finished the house.\n",
      "King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.\n",
      "Hiram sent in the navy his servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.\n",
      "They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.\n",
      "When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning Yahweh’s name, she came to prove him with hard questions.\n",
      "She came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart.\n",
      "Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hidden from the king which he didn’t tell her.\n",
      "When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,\n",
      "and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing, and his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to Yahweh’s house; there was no more spirit in her.\n",
      "She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.\n",
      "However I didn’t believe the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it. Behold, the half was not told me! Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.\n",
      "Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, who hear your wisdom.\n",
      "Blessed is Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel. Because Yahweh loved Israel forever, therefore made he you king, to do justice and righteousness.”\n",
      "She gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones. There came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.\n",
      "The navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones.\n",
      "The king made of the almug trees pillars for Yahweh’s house, and for the king’s house, harps also and stringed instruments for the singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen, to this day.\n",
      "King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.\n",
      "Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,\n",
      "besides that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mixed people, and of the governors of the country.\n",
      "King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler.\n",
      "he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.\n",
      "Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.\n",
      "There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.\n",
      "Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.\n",
      "All king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.\n",
      "For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.\n",
      "So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.\n",
      "All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.\n",
      "They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.\n",
      "Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he kept in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.\n",
      "The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.\n",
      "The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.\n",
      "A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means.\n",
      "Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;\n",
      "of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children of Israel, “You shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.” Solomon joined to these in love.\n",
      "He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.\n",
      "When Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as was the heart of David his father.\n",
      "For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.\n",
      "Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and didn’t go fully after Yahweh, as did David his father.\n",
      "Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "So he did for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.\n",
      "Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,\n",
      "and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he didn’t keep that which Yahweh commanded.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, “Because this is done by you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.\n",
      "Notwithstanding I will not do it in your days, for David your father’s sake; but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.\n",
      "However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.”\n",
      "Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon: Hadad the Edomite. He was one of the king’s offspring in Edom.\n",
      "For when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had struck every male in Edom\n",
      "(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);\n",
      "Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.\n",
      "They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him food, and gave him land.\n",
      "Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.\n",
      "The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.\n",
      "When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.”\n",
      "Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own country?” He answered, “Nothing, however only let me depart.”\n",
      "God raised up an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.\n",
      "He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.\n",
      "He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief of Hadad: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.\n",
      "Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.\n",
      "This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.\n",
      "The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph.\n",
      "At that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.\n",
      "Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.\n",
      "He said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces; for Yahweh says, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you\n",
      "(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);\n",
      "because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon. They have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my ordinances, as David his father did.\n",
      "“‘However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;\n",
      "but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.\n",
      "To his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.\n",
      "I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.\n",
      "It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.\n",
      "I will for this afflict the offspring of David, but not forever.’”\n",
      "Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren’t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon?\n",
      "The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.\n",
      "Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.\n",
      "When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,\n",
      "and they sent and called him), Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,\n",
      "“Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.”\n",
      "He said to them, “Depart for three days, then come back to me.” The people departed.\n",
      "King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, “What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people?”\n",
      "They spoke to him, saying, “If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”\n",
      "But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.\n",
      "He said to them, “What counsel do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’”\n",
      "The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall tell this people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter to us; ’ you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.\n",
      "Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’”\n",
      "So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.”\n",
      "The king answered the people roughly, and abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him,\n",
      "and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”\n",
      "So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh, that he might establish his word, which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n",
      "When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion have we in David? Neither do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So Israel departed to their tents.\n",
      "But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.\n",
      "Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.\n",
      "So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.\n",
      "When all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was no one who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.\n",
      "When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.\n",
      "But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,\n",
      "“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,\n",
      "‘Yahweh says, “You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers, the children of Israel. Everyone return to his house; for this thing is of me.”’” So they listened to Yahweh’s word, and returned and went their way, according to Yahweh’s word.\n",
      "Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived in it; and he went out from there, and built Penuel.\n",
      "Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.\n",
      "If this people goes up to offer sacrifices in Yahweh’s house at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”\n",
      "Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Look and see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”\n",
      "He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.\n",
      "This thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one, even to Dan.\n",
      "He made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.\n",
      "Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; he did so in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.\n",
      "He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense.\n",
      "Behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by Yahweh’s word to Beth El: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.\n",
      "He cried against the altar by Yahweh’s word, and said, “Altar, altar, Yahweh says: ‘Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name. On you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and they will burn men’s bones on you.’”\n",
      "He gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken: Behold, the altar will be split apart, and the ashes that are on it will be poured out.”\n",
      "When the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam put out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” His hand, which he put out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to himself.\n",
      "The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by Yahweh’s word.\n",
      "The king answered the man of God, “Now entreat the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.” The man of God entreated Yahweh, and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.\n",
      "The king said to the man of God, “Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”\n",
      "The man of God said to the king, “Even if you gave me half of your house, I would not go in with you, neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place;\n",
      "for so was it commanded me by Yahweh’s word, saying, ‘You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that you came.’”\n",
      "So he went another way, and didn’t return by the way that he came to Bethel.\n",
      "Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king.\n",
      "Their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who came from Judah.\n",
      "He said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it.\n",
      "He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. He said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” He said, “I am.”\n",
      "Then he said to him, “Come home with me, and eat bread.”\n",
      "He said, “I may not return with you, nor go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place.\n",
      "For it was said to me by Yahweh’s word, ‘You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you came.’”\n",
      "He said to him, “I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by Yahweh’s word, saying, ‘Bring him back with you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.’” He lied to him.\n",
      "So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.\n",
      "As they sat at the table, Yahweh’s word came to the prophet who brought him back;\n",
      "and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh, and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you,\n",
      "but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, “Eat no bread, and drink no water”; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.’”\n",
      "After he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.\n",
      "When he had gone, a lion met him by the way and killed him. His body was cast on the path, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the body.\n",
      "Behold, men passed by, and saw the body thrown on the path, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.\n",
      "When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who was disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh. Therefore Yahweh has delivered him to the lion, which has mauled him and slain him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke to him.”\n",
      "He spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me.” They saddled it.\n",
      "He went and found his body thrown on the path, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body, nor mauled the donkey.\n",
      "The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn, and to bury him.\n",
      "He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”\n",
      "After he had buried him, he spoke to his sons, saying, “When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.\n",
      "For the saying which he cried by Yahweh’s word against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely happen.”\n",
      "After this thing Jeroboam didn’t return from his evil way, but again made priests of the high places from among all the people. Whoever wanted to, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.\n",
      "This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth.\n",
      "At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.\n",
      "Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please get up and disguise yourself, that you won’t be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Go to Shiloh. Behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people.\n",
      "Take with you ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the child.”\n",
      "Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick. Thus and thus you shall tell her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.”\n",
      "It was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, “Come in, you wife of Jeroboam! Why do you pretend to be another? For I am sent to you with heavy news.\n",
      "Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Yahweh says, the God of Israel: “Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over my people Israel,\n",
      "and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes,\n",
      "but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:\n",
      "therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall, he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweeps away dung, until it is all gone.\n",
      "He who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat: for Yahweh has spoken it.”’\n",
      "Arise therefore, and go to your house. When your feet enter into the city, the child shall die.\n",
      "All Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.\n",
      "Moreover Yahweh will raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is day! What? Even now.\n",
      "For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking Yahweh to anger.\n",
      "He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.”\n",
      "Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.\n",
      "All Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.\n",
      "The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.\n",
      "The days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.\n",
      "Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.\n",
      "For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherah poles, on every high hill, and under every green tree;\n",
      "and there were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel.\n",
      "In the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;\n",
      "and he took away the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.\n",
      "King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.\n",
      "It was so, that as often as the king went into Yahweh’s house, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard room.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.\n",
      "Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah.\n",
      "He reigned three years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.\n",
      "He walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as the heart of David his father.\n",
      "Nevertheless for David’s sake, Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem;\n",
      "because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and didn’t turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.\n",
      "Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.\n",
      "The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.\n",
      "Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah.\n",
      "He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.\n",
      "Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, as did David his father.\n",
      "He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.\n",
      "Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.\n",
      "But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all his days.\n",
      "He brought into Yahweh’s house the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.\n",
      "There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.\n",
      "Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.\n",
      "Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben Hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,\n",
      "“There is a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.”\n",
      "Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.\n",
      "When Baasha heard of it, he left off building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah.\n",
      "Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; no one was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.\n",
      "Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.\n",
      "Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.\n",
      "He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.\n",
      "Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.\n",
      "Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha killed him, and reigned in his place.\n",
      "As soon as he was king, he struck all the house of Jeroboam. He didn’t leave to Jeroboam any who breathed, until he had destroyed him; according to the saying of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;\n",
      "for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.\n",
      "In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah for twenty-four years.\n",
      "He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,\n",
      "“Because I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;\n",
      "behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n",
      "The dogs will eat Baasha’s descendants who die in the city; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat.”\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came Yahweh’s word against Baasha, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck him.\n",
      "In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah for two years.\n",
      "His servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:\n",
      "and Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.\n",
      "When he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, he struck all the house of Baasha: he didn’t leave him a single one who urinates on a wall, neither of his relatives, nor of his friends.\n",
      "Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,\n",
      "for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.\n",
      "The people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also struck the king: therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.\n",
      "Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.\n",
      "When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the castle of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,\n",
      "for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he committed, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.\n",
      "But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.\n",
      "In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel for twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirzah.\n",
      "He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.\n",
      "Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt wickedly above all who were before him.\n",
      "For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.\n",
      "Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh above all that were before him.\n",
      "As if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.\n",
      "He reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.\n",
      "Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.\n",
      "In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho: he laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.\n",
      "Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the foreigners of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.”\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came to him, saying,\n",
      "“Go away from here, turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.\n",
      "It shall be, that you shall drink of the brook. I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.”\n",
      "So he went and did according to Yahweh’s word; for he went and lived by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.\n",
      "The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.\n",
      "After a while, the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came to him, saying,\n",
      "“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain you.”\n",
      "So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, “Please get me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.”\n",
      "As she was going to get it, he called to her, and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.”\n",
      "She said, “As Yahweh your God lives, I don’t have a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the jar. Behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.”\n",
      "Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do as you have said; but make me of it a little cake first, and bring it out to me, and afterward make some for you and for your son.\n",
      "For Yahweh, the God of Israel says, ‘The jar of meal shall not empty, neither shall the jar of oil fail, until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth.’”\n",
      "She went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, ate many days.\n",
      "The jar of meal didn’t empty, neither did the jar of oil fail, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by Elijah.\n",
      "After these things, the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him.\n",
      "She said to Elijah, “What have I to do with you, you man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to memory, and to kill my son!”\n",
      "He said to her, “Give me your son.” He took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the room where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed.\n",
      "He cried to Yahweh, and said, “Yahweh my God, have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I stay, by killing her son?”\n",
      "He stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh, and said, “Yahweh my God, please let this child’s soul come into him again.”\n",
      "Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.\n",
      "Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the room into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Elijah said, “Behold, your son lives.”\n",
      "The woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that Yahweh’s word in your mouth is truth.”\n",
      "After many days, Yahweh’s word came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, “Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.”\n",
      "Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria.\n",
      "Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly:\n",
      "for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh, that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)\n",
      "Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the animals.”\n",
      "So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.\n",
      "As Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”\n",
      "He answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here!’”\n",
      "He said, “Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?\n",
      "As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you. When they said, ‘He is not here, ’ he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they didn’t find you.\n",
      "Now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’\n",
      "It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that Yahweh’s Spirit will carry you I don’t know where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can’t find you, he will kill me. But I, your servant, have feared Yahweh from my youth.\n",
      "Wasn’t it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred men of Yahweh’s prophets with fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water?\n",
      "Now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here”; ’ and he will kill me.”\n",
      "Elijah said, “As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.”\n",
      "So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.\n",
      "When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”\n",
      "He answered, “I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father’s house, in that you have forsaken Yahweh’s commandments, and you have followed the Baals.\n",
      "Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and four hundred fifty of the prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”\n",
      "So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel.\n",
      "Elijah came near to all the people, and said, “How long will you waver between the two sides? If Yahweh is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” The people answered him not a word.\n",
      "Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of Yahweh; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred fifty men.\n",
      "Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it.\n",
      "You call on the name of your god, and I will call on Yahweh’s name. The God who answers by fire, let him be God.” All the people answered, “It is well said.”\n",
      "Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.”\n",
      "They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, “Baal, hear us!” But there was no voice, nor any who answered. They leaped about the altar which was made.\n",
      "At noon, Elijah mocked them, and said, “Cry aloud; for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened.”\n",
      "They cried aloud, and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.\n",
      "It was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any who regarded.\n",
      "Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me”; and all the people came near to him. He repaired the altar of Yahweh that was thrown down.\n",
      "Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom Yahweh’s word came, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”\n",
      "With the stones he built an altar in Yahweh’s name. He made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of seed.\n",
      "He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, “Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.”\n",
      "He said, “Do it a second time”; and they did it the second time. He said, “Do it a third time”; and they did it the third time.\n",
      "The water ran around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.\n",
      "At the time of the offering of the offering, Elijah the prophet came near, and said, “Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.\n",
      "Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know that you, Yahweh, are God, and that you have turned their heart back again.”\n",
      "Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.\n",
      "When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. They said, “Yahweh, he is God! Yahweh, he is God!”\n",
      "Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Don’t let one of them escape!” They seized them. Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.\n",
      "Elijah said to Ahab, “Get up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.”\n",
      "So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees.\n",
      "He said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” He went up, and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” He said, “Go again” seven times.\n",
      "On the seventh time, he said, “Behold, a small cloud, like a man’s hand, is rising out of the sea.” He said, “Go up, tell Ahab, ‘Get ready and go down, so that the rain doesn’t stop you.’”\n",
      "In a little while, the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.\n",
      "The hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.\n",
      "Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.\n",
      "Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I don’t make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time!”\n",
      "When he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.\n",
      "But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, “It is enough. Now, O Yahweh, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.”\n",
      "He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise and eat!”\n",
      "He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again.\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel came again the second time, and touched him, and said, “Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.”\n",
      "He arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the Mount of God.\n",
      "He came there to a cave, and camped there; and behold, Yahweh’s word came to him, and he said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”\n",
      "He said, “I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.”\n",
      "He said, “Go out, and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.” Behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind. After the wind an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake.\n",
      "After the earthquake a fire passed; but Yahweh was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\n",
      "It was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. Behold, a voice came to him, and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”\n",
      "He said, “I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.\n",
      "You shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your place.\n",
      "It shall happen, that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill.\n",
      "Yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.”\n",
      "So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to him, and cast his mantle on him.\n",
      "He left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me please kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” He said to him, “Go back again; for what have I done to you?”\n",
      "He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and served him.\n",
      "Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together; and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.\n",
      "He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him, “Thus says Ben Hadad,\n",
      "‘Your silver and your gold is mine. Your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.’”\n",
      "The king of Israel answered, “It is according to your saying, my lord, O king. I am yours, and all that I have.”\n",
      "The messengers came again, and said, “Ben Hadad says, ‘I sent indeed to you, saying, “You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;\n",
      "but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.”’”\n",
      "Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, “Please notice how this man seeks mischief; for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn’t deny him.”\n",
      "All the elders and all the people said to him, “Don’t listen, neither consent.”\n",
      "Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you sent for to your servant at the first I will do; but this thing I cannot do.’” The messengers departed, and brought him back the message.\n",
      "Ben Hadad sent to him, and said, “The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.”\n",
      "The king of Israel answered, “Tell him, ‘Don’t let him who puts on his armor brag like he who takes it off.’”\n",
      "When Ben Hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, he said to his servants, “Prepare to attack!” They prepared to attack the city.\n",
      "Behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.’”\n",
      "Ahab said, “By whom?” He said, “Yahweh says, ‘By the young men of the princes of the provinces.’” Then he said, “Who shall begin the battle?” He answered, “You.”\n",
      "Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two. After them, he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.\n",
      "They went out at noon. But Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him.\n",
      "The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, “Men are coming out from Samaria.”\n",
      "He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.”\n",
      "So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.\n",
      "They each killed his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.\n",
      "The king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.\n",
      "The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.”\n",
      "The servants of the king of Syria said to him, “Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.\n",
      "Do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their place.\n",
      "Muster an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. We will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than them.” He listened to their voice, and did so.\n",
      "At the return of the year, Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.\n",
      "The children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and went against them. The children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of young goats; but the Syrians filled the country.\n",
      "A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘Because the Syrians have said, “Yahweh is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys”; therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Yahweh.’”\n",
      "They encamped one over against the other seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the Syrians in one day.\n",
      "But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner room.\n",
      "His servants said to him, “See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let us put sackcloth on our bodies, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he will save your life.”\n",
      "So they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, “Your servant Ben Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’” He said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”\n",
      "Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to take this phrase; and they said, “Your brother Ben Hadad.” Then he said, “Go, bring him.” Then Ben Hadad came out to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.\n",
      "Ben Hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore. You shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.” “I”, said Ahab, “will let you go with this covenant.” So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.\n",
      "A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by Yahweh’s word, “Please strike me!” The man refused to strike him.\n",
      "Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall kill you.” As soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and killed him.\n",
      "Then he found another man, and said, “Please strike me.” The man struck him, smiting and wounding him.\n",
      "So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.\n",
      "As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said, “Your servant went out into the middle of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, ‘Guard this man! If by any means he be missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’\n",
      "As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” The king of Israel said to him, “So your judgment shall be; you yourself have decided it.”\n",
      "He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized that he was of the prophets.\n",
      "He said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.’”\n",
      "The king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.\n",
      "After these things, Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.\n",
      "Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house; and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.”\n",
      "Naboth said to Ahab, “May Yahweh forbid me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!”\n",
      "Ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” He laid himself down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.\n",
      "But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, “Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?”\n",
      "He said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ He answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”\n",
      "Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”\n",
      "So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, who lived with Naboth.\n",
      "She wrote in the letters, saying, “Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.\n",
      "Set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, ‘You cursed God and the king!’ Then carry him out, and stone him to death.”\n",
      "The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.\n",
      "They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.\n",
      "The two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him. The base fellows testified against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king!” Then they carried him out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones.\n",
      "Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned, and is dead.”\n",
      "When Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.”\n",
      "When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,\n",
      "“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it.\n",
      "You shall speak to him, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “Have you killed and also taken possession?”’ You shall speak to him, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs will lick your blood, even yours.”’”\n",
      "Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, my enemy?” He answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh.\n",
      "Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel.\n",
      "I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.”\n",
      "Yahweh also spoke of Jezebel, saying, “The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.\n",
      "The dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field.”\n",
      "But there was no one like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.\n",
      "He did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.\n",
      "When Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,\n",
      "“See how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son’s days will I bring the evil on his house.”\n",
      "They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.\n",
      "In the third year, Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.\n",
      "The king of Israel said to his servants, “You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we are still, and don’t take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?”\n",
      "He said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”\n",
      "Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for Yahweh’s word.”\n",
      "Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” They said, “Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.”\n",
      "But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of him?”\n",
      "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.” Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.”\n",
      "Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, “Quickly get Micaiah the son of Imlah.”\n",
      "Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.\n",
      "Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘With these you shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’”\n",
      "All the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.”\n",
      "The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “See now, the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak good.”\n",
      "Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me, that I will speak.”\n",
      "When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?” He answered him, “Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.”\n",
      "The king said to him, “How many times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in Yahweh’s name?”\n",
      "He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh said, ‘These have no master. Let them each return to his house in peace.’”\n",
      "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”\n",
      "Micaiah said, “Therefore hear Yahweh’s word. I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.\n",
      "Yahweh said, ‘Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ One said one thing; and another said another.\n",
      "A spirit came out and stood before Yahweh, and said, ‘I will entice him.’\n",
      "Yahweh said to him, ‘How?’ He said, ‘I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ He said, ‘You will entice him, and will also prevail. Go out and do so.’\n",
      "Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.”\n",
      "Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did Yahweh’s Spirit go from me to speak to you?”\n",
      "Micaiah said, “Behold, you will see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.”\n",
      "The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son.\n",
      "Say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.”’”\n",
      "Micaiah said, “If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.” He said, “Listen, all you people!”\n",
      "So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.\n",
      "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes.” The king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.\n",
      "Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.\n",
      "When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely that is the king of Israel!” and they turned aside to fight against him. Jehoshaphat cried out.\n",
      "When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.\n",
      "A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn your hand, and carry me out of the battle; for I am severely wounded.”\n",
      "The battle increased that day. The king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.\n",
      "A cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, “Every man to his city, and every man to his country!”\n",
      "So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.\n",
      "They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves; according to Yahweh’s word which he spoke.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.\n",
      "He walked in all the way of Asa his father; He didn’t turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh: however the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he fought, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.\n",
      "There was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they didn’t go; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber.\n",
      "Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat would not.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; Jehoram his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.\n",
      "He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he made Israel to sin.\n",
      "He served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.\n",
      "Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.\n",
      "Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.”\n",
      "But Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?\n",
      "Now therefore Yahweh says, “You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.”’” Elijah departed.\n",
      "The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?”\n",
      "They said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, “Yahweh says, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.’”’”\n",
      "He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?”\n",
      "They answered him, “He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.” He said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”\n",
      "Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down!’”\n",
      "Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.\n",
      "Again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. He answered him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’”\n",
      "Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” The fire of God came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.\n",
      "Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight.\n",
      "Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.”\n",
      "Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.” He arose, and went down with him to the king.\n",
      "He said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.’”\n",
      "So he died according to Yahweh’s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up by a whirlwind into heaven, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.\n",
      "Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.” Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.\n",
      "The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?” He said, “Yes, I know it; hold your peace.”\n",
      "Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.” He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho.\n",
      "The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?” He answered, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”\n",
      "Elijah said to him, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.” He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” They both went on.\n",
      "Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan.\n",
      "Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they two went over on dry ground.\n",
      "When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.” Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.”\n",
      "He said, “You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.”\n",
      "As they still went on, and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\n",
      "Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” He saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.\n",
      "He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.\n",
      "He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” When he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha went over.\n",
      "When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.\n",
      "They said to him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps Yahweh’s Spirit has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or into some valley. He said, “You shall not send them.”\n",
      "When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.” They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him.\n",
      "They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go?’”\n",
      "The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land miscarries.”\n",
      "He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” They brought it to him.\n",
      "He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying.’”\n",
      "So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.\n",
      "He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!”\n",
      "He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in Yahweh’s name. Two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths.\n",
      "He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.\n",
      "Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.\n",
      "He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.\n",
      "Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he didn’t depart from it.\n",
      "Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams.\n",
      "But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.\n",
      "King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.\n",
      "He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?” He said, “I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”\n",
      "He said, “Which way shall we go up?” He answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.”\n",
      "So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey. There was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them.\n",
      "The king of Israel said, “Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”\n",
      "But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him?” One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.”\n",
      "Jehoshaphat said, “Yahweh’s word is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.\n",
      "Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.” The king of Israel said to him, “No; for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”\n",
      "Elisha said, “As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.\n",
      "But now bring me a minstrel.” When the minstrel played, the hand of Yahweh came on him.\n",
      "He said, “Yahweh says, ‘Make this valley full of trenches.’\n",
      "For Yahweh says, ‘You will not see wind, neither will you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your animals.\n",
      "This is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.\n",
      "You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’”\n",
      "In the morning, about the time of offering the offering, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.\n",
      "Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.\n",
      "They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood.\n",
      "They said, “This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the plunder!”\n",
      "When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.\n",
      "They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth only they left its stones; however the men armed with slings went about it, and struck it.\n",
      "When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.\n",
      "Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.\n",
      "Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared Yahweh. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to be slaves.”\n",
      "Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?” She said, “Your handmaid has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.”\n",
      "Then he said, “Go, borrow containers from of all your neighbors, even empty containers. Don’t borrow just a few.\n",
      "You shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those containers; and you shall set aside that which is full.”\n",
      "So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought the containers to her, and she poured out.\n",
      "When the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.” He said to her, “There isn’t another container.” The oil stopped flowing.\n",
      "Then she came and told the man of God. He said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.”\n",
      "It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.\n",
      "She said to her husband, “See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually.\n",
      "Please let us make a little room on the wall. Let us set for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand. It shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there.”\n",
      "One day he came there, and he turned into the room and lay there.\n",
      "He said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him.\n",
      "He said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?’” She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”\n",
      "He said, “What then is to be done for her?” Gehazi answered, “Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old.”\n",
      "He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the door.\n",
      "He said, “At this season, when the time comes around, you will embrace a son.” She said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.”\n",
      "The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her.\n",
      "When the child was grown, one day he went out to his father to the reapers.\n",
      "He said to his father, “My head! My head!” He said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”\n",
      "When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.\n",
      "She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went out.\n",
      "She called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.”\n",
      "He said, “Why would you want go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.” She said, “It’s alright.”\n",
      "Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward! Don’t slow down for me, unless I ask you to.”\n",
      "So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her afar off, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Behold, there is the Shunammite.\n",
      "Please run now to meet her, and ask her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?’” She answered, “It is well.”\n",
      "When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, “Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told me.”\n",
      "Then she said, “Did I desire a son of my lord? Didn’t I say, Do not deceive me?”\n",
      "Then he said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don’t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don’t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the face of the child.”\n",
      "The mother of the child said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” He arose, and followed her.\n",
      "Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, “The child has not awakened.”\n",
      "When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.\n",
      "He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh.\n",
      "He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew warm.\n",
      "Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.\n",
      "He called Gehazi, and said, “Call this Shunammite!” So he called her. When she had come in to him, he said, “Take up your son.”\n",
      "Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.\n",
      "Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Set on the great pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”\n",
      "One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for they didn’t recognize them.\n",
      "So they poured out for the men to eat. As they were eating some of the stew, they cried out, and said, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” They could not eat of it.\n",
      "But he said, “Then bring meal.” He cast it into the pot; and he said, “Pour out for the people, that they may eat.” There was no harm in the pot.\n",
      "A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, “Give to the people, that they may eat.”\n",
      "His servant said, “What, should I set this before a hundred men?” But he said, “Give the people, that they may eat; for Yahweh says, ‘They will eat, and will have some left over.’”\n",
      "So he set it before them, and they ate, and left some of it, according to Yahweh’s word.\n",
      "Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.\n",
      "The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.\n",
      "She said to her mistress, “I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.”\n",
      "Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, “The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this.”\n",
      "The king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.\n",
      "He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, “Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.”\n",
      "When the king of Israel had read the letter, he tore his clothes, and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.”\n",
      "It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”\n",
      "So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.\n",
      "Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.”\n",
      "But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.’\n",
      "Aren’t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them, and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.\n",
      "His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn’t you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean?’”\n",
      "Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.\n",
      "He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, “See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.”\n",
      "But he said, “As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none.” He urged him to take it; but he refused.\n",
      "Naaman said, “If not, then, please let two mules’ burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.\n",
      "In this thing may Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.”\n",
      "He said to him, “Go in peace.” So he departed from him a little way.\n",
      "But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.”\n",
      "So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?”\n",
      "He said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.’”\n",
      "Naaman said, “Be pleased to take two talents.” He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him.\n",
      "When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed.\n",
      "But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where did you come from, Gehazi?” He said, “Your servant went nowhere.”\n",
      "He said to him, “Didn’t my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?\n",
      "Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your offspring forever.” He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.\n",
      "The sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See now, the place where we dwell before you is too small for us.\n",
      "Please let us go to the Jordan, and every man take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.” He answered, “Go!”\n",
      "One said, “Please be pleased to go with your servants.” He answered, “I will go.”\n",
      "So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.\n",
      "But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water. Then he cried, and said, “Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.”\n",
      "The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” He showed him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float.\n",
      "He said, “Take it.” So he put out his hand and took it.\n",
      "Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, “My camp will be in such and such a place.”\n",
      "The man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you not pass such a place; for the Syrians are coming down there.”\n",
      "The king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.\n",
      "The heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them, “Won’t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?”\n",
      "One of his servants said, “No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”\n",
      "He said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.” It was told him, saying, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”\n",
      "Therefore he sent horses, chariots, and a great army there. They came by night, and surrounded the city.\n",
      "When the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”\n",
      "He answered, “Don’t be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”\n",
      "Elisha prayed, and said, “Yahweh, please open his eyes, that he may see.” Yahweh opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha.\n",
      "When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Please strike this people with blindness.” He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.\n",
      "Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” He led them to Samaria.\n",
      "When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, “Yahweh, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.” Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the middle of Samaria.\n",
      "The king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, “My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?”\n",
      "He answered, “You shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.”\n",
      "He prepared great feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. The bands of Syria stopped raiding the land of Israel.\n",
      "After this, Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.\n",
      "There was a great famine in Samaria. Behold, they besieged it, until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver.\n",
      "As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”\n",
      "He said, “If Yahweh doesn’t help you, from where could I help you? From of the threshing floor, or from the wine press?”\n",
      "The king said to her, “What ails you?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’\n",
      "So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him; ’ and she has hidden her son.”\n",
      "When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes (now he was passing by on the wall); and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his flesh.\n",
      "Then he said, “God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stay on him this day.”\n",
      "But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a man from before him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door shut against him. Isn’t the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”\n",
      "While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. Then he said, “Behold, this evil is from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?”\n",
      "Elisha said, “Hear Yahweh’s word. Yahweh says, ‘Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.’”\n",
      "Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, “Behold, if Yahweh made windows in heaven, could this thing be?” He said, “Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it.”\n",
      "Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said to one another, “Why do we sit here until we die?\n",
      "If we say, ‘We will enter into the city, ’ then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die.”\n",
      "They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.\n",
      "For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said to one another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.\n",
      "Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.\n",
      "When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it.\n",
      "Then they said to one another, “We aren’t doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.”\n",
      "So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, “We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.”\n",
      "He called the porters; and they told it to the king’s household within.\n",
      "The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, “I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.’”\n",
      "One of his servants answered, “Please let some take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let us send and see.”\n",
      "They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, “Go and see.”\n",
      "They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king.\n",
      "The people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to Yahweh’s word.\n",
      "The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trod on him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.\n",
      "It happened as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria”;\n",
      "and that captain answered the man of God, and said, “Now, behold, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?” and he said, “Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it.”\n",
      "It happened like that to him; for the people trod on him in the gate, and he died.\n",
      "Now Elisha had spoken to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise, and go, you and your household, and stay for a while wherever you can; for Yahweh has called for a famine. It shall also come on the land seven years.”\n",
      "The woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God. She went with her household, and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years.\n",
      "At the seven years’ end, the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines. Then she went out to cry to the king for her house and for her land.\n",
      "Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.”\n",
      "As he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.”\n",
      "When the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, “Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.”\n",
      "Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick. It was told him, saying, “The man of God has come here.”\n",
      "The king said to Hazael, “Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Yahweh by him, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”\n",
      "So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, “Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”\n",
      "Elisha said to him, “Go, tell him, ‘You shall surely recover; ’ however Yahweh has shown me that he shall surely die.”\n",
      "He settled his gaze steadfastly on him, until he was ashamed. Then the man of God wept.\n",
      "Hazael said, “Why do you weep, my lord?” He answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and will dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.”\n",
      "Hazael said, “But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?” Elisha answered, “Yahweh has shown me that you will be king over Syria.”\n",
      "Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” He answered, “He told me that you would surely recover.”\n",
      "On the next day, he took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died. Then Hazael reigned in his place.\n",
      "In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.\n",
      "He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign. He reigned eight years in Jerusalem.\n",
      "He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.\n",
      "However Yahweh would not destroy Judah, for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give to him a lamp for his children always.\n",
      "In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.\n",
      "Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.\n",
      "So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.\n",
      "The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.\n",
      "Twenty-two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.\n",
      "He walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.\n",
      "He went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.\n",
      "King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.\n",
      "Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, “Put your belt on your waist, take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.\n",
      "When you come there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner room.\n",
      "Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, ‘Yahweh says, “I have anointed you king over Israel.”’ Then open the door, flee, and don’t wait.”\n",
      "So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.\n",
      "When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting. Then he said, “I have a message for you, captain.” Jehu said, “To which of us all?” He said, “To you, O captain.”\n",
      "He arose, and went into the house. Then he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, “Yahweh says, the God of Israel, ‘I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh, even over Israel.\n",
      "You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel.\n",
      "For the whole house of Ahab shall perish. I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel.\n",
      "I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.\n",
      "The dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel, and there shall be no one to bury her.’” He opened the door, and fled.\n",
      "Then Jehu came out to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, “Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?” He said to them, “You know the man and what his talk was.”\n",
      "They said, “That is a lie. Tell us now.” He said, “He said to me, ‘Yahweh says, I have anointed you king over Israel.’”\n",
      "Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king.”\n",
      "So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;\n",
      "but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, “If this is your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.”\n",
      "So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.\n",
      "Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.” Joram said, “Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”\n",
      "So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’” Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!” The watchman said, “The messenger came to them, but he isn’t coming back.”\n",
      "Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’” Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”\n",
      "The watchman said, “He came to them, and isn’t coming back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.”\n",
      "Joram said, “Get ready!” They got his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.\n",
      "When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” He answered, “What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?”\n",
      "Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “There is treason, Ahaziah!”\n",
      "Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.\n",
      "Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, “Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him:\n",
      "‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, ’ says Yahweh; ‘and I will repay you in this plot of ground, ’ says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast him onto the plot of ground, according to Yahweh’s word.”\n",
      "But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, “Strike him also in the chariot!” They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there.\n",
      "His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.\n",
      "In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.\n",
      "When Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.\n",
      "As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, “Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?”\n",
      "He lifted up his face to the window, and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.\n",
      "He said, “Throw her down!” So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot.\n",
      "When he had come in, he ate and drink; and he said, “See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.”\n",
      "They went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.\n",
      "Therefore they came back, and told him. He said, “This is Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on the plot of Jezreel,\n",
      "and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, “This is Jezebel.”’”\n",
      "Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab, saying,\n",
      "“Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor.\n",
      "Select the best and fittest of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”\n",
      "But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Behold, the two kings didn’t stand before him! How then shall we stand?”\n",
      "He who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who raised the children, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and will do all that you ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good in your eyes.”\n",
      "Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time.” Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.\n",
      "When the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons, and killed them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.\n",
      "A messenger came, and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.” He said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.”\n",
      "In the morning, he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, “You are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master, and killed him; but who struck all these?\n",
      "Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of Yahweh’s word, which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab. For Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.”\n",
      "So Jehu struck all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, with all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him no one remaining.\n",
      "He arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way,\n",
      "Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who are you?” They answered, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen.”\n",
      "He said, “Take them alive!” They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even forty-two men. He didn’t leave any of them.\n",
      "When he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?” Jehonadab answered, “It is.” “If it is, give me your hand.” He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.\n",
      "He said, “Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh.” So they made him ride in his chariot.\n",
      "When he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke to Elijah.\n",
      "Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.\n",
      "Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all of his worshipers, and all of his priests. Let no one be absent; for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent, he shall not live.” But Jehu did it in subtlety, intending that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal.\n",
      "Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!” They proclaimed it.\n",
      "Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn’t come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.\n",
      "He said to him who was over the vestry, “Bring out robes for all the worshipers of Baal!” He brought robes out to them.\n",
      "Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal. Then he said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search, and look that there are here with you none of the servants of Yahweh, but the worshipers of Baal only.”\n",
      "They went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him eighty men outside, and said, “If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.”\n",
      "As soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in, and kill them! Let no one escape.” They struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.\n",
      "They brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.\n",
      "They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day.\n",
      "Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.\n",
      "However from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, Jehu didn’t depart from after them, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.”\n",
      "But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin.\n",
      "In those days Yahweh began to cut off from Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel;\n",
      "from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n",
      "Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.\n",
      "Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring.\n",
      "But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedroom; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain;\n",
      "He was with her hidden in Yahweh’s house six years. Athaliah reigned over the land.\n",
      "In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into Yahweh’s house; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in Yahweh’s house, and showed them the king’s son.\n",
      "He commanded them, saying, “This is the thing that you shall do: a third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;\n",
      "A third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard. So you shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.\n",
      "The two companies of you, even all who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of Yahweh’s house around the king.\n",
      "You shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks, let him be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.”\n",
      "The captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.\n",
      "The priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David’s, which were in Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "The guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king.\n",
      "Then he brought out the king’s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!”\n",
      "When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into Yahweh’s house:\n",
      "and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the tradition was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, “Treason! Treason!”\n",
      "Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks. Kill him who follows her with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t let her be slain in Yahweh’s house.”\n",
      "So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses’ entry to the king’s house. She was slain there.\n",
      "Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, that they should be Yahweh’s people; between the king also and the people.\n",
      "All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. The priest appointed officers over Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "He took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from Yahweh’s house, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. He sat on the throne of the kings.\n",
      "So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king’s house.\n",
      "Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.\n",
      "In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.\n",
      "Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.\n",
      "However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.\n",
      "Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the holy things that is brought into Yahweh’s house, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it comes into any man’s heart to bring into Yahweh’s house,\n",
      "let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found.”\n",
      "But it was so, that in the twenty-third year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.\n",
      "Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, “Why don’t you repair the breaches of the house? Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.”\n",
      "The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.\n",
      "But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into Yahweh’s house: and the priests who kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "It was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of Yahweh’s house: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on Yahweh’s house,\n",
      "and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of Yahweh’s house, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.\n",
      "But there were not made for Yahweh’s house cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house;\n",
      "for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired therewith Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "Moreover they didn’t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.\n",
      "The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings, was not brought into Yahweh’s house: it was the priests’.\n",
      "Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.\n",
      "Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own holy things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and of the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "His servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.\n",
      "For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years.\n",
      "He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he didn’t depart from it.\n",
      "Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.\n",
      "Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them.\n",
      "(Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before.\n",
      "Nevertheless they didn’t depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)\n",
      "For he didn’t leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.\n",

      "Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over him, and said, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”\n",
      "Elisha said to him, “Take bow and arrows”; and he took to him bow and arrows.\n",

      "He said, “Open the window eastward”; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot!” and he shot. He said, “Yahweh’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you shall strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed them.”\n",
      "He said, “Take the arrows”; and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground”; and he struck three times, and stopped.\n",
      "The man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it, whereas now you shall strike Syria just three times.”\n",

      "You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your harm, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?’”\n",

      "Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.\n",
      "The king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.\n",
      "Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.\n",
      "In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.\n",
      "It was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,\n",
      "and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.\n",
      "The children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;\n",
      "and they set them up pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill, and under every green tree;\n",
      "and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;\n",
      "and they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them, “You shall not do this thing.”\n",
      "Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.”\n",
      "Notwithstanding, they would not listen, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who didn’t believe in Yahweh their God.\n",
      "They rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom Yahweh had commanded them that they should not do like them.\n",
      "They abandoned all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served Baal.\n",
      "They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.\n",
      "Also Judah didn’t keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.\n",
      "Yahweh rejected all the offspring of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of raiders, until he had cast them out of his sight.\n",
      "For he tore Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin.\n",
      "The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn’t depart from them;\n",
      "until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he spoke by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.\n",
      "The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and lived in the cities of it.\n",
      "So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn’t fear Yahweh: therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.\n",
      "Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations which you have carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, don’t know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them, because they don’t know the law of the god of the land.”\n",
      "Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.”\n",
      "So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh.\n",
      "However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.\n",
      "The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,\n",
      "and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.\n",
      "So they feared Yahweh, and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.\n",
      "They feared Yahweh, and served their own gods, after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.\n",
      "To this day they do what they did before: they don’t fear Yahweh, neither do they follow their statutes, or their ordinances, or the law or the commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;\n",
      "with whom Yahweh had made a covenant, and commanded them, saying, “You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;\n",
      "but you shall fear Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, and you shall bow yourselves to him, and you shall sacrifice to him.\n",
      "The statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever more. You shall not fear other gods.\n",
      "You shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you; neither shall you fear other gods.\n",
      "But you shall fear Yahweh your God; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.”\n",
      "However they did not listen, but they did what they did before.\n",
      "So these nations feared Yahweh, and served their engraved images. Their children likewise, and their children’s children, as their fathers did, so they do to this day.\n",
      "Now in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.\n",
      "He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.\n",
      "He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done.\n",
      "He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.\n",
      "He trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel; so that after him was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him.\n",
      "For he joined with Yahweh; he didn’t depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses.\n",
      "Yahweh was with him; wherever he went, he prospered. He rebelled against the king of Assyria, and didn’t serve him.\n",
      "He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.\n",
      "In the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.\n",
      "At the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.\n",
      "The king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,\n",
      "because they didn’t obey the voice of Yahweh their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.\n",
      "Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.\n",
      "Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, “I have offended; return from me. That which you put on me, I will bear.” The king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.\n",
      "Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in Yahweh’s house, and in the treasures of the king’s house.\n",
      "At that time, Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh’s temple, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.\n",
      "The king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field.\n",
      "When they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.\n",
      "Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What confidence is this in which you trust?\n",
      "You say (but they are but vain words), ‘There is counsel and strength for war.’ Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?\n",
      "Now, behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt. If a man leans on it, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.\n",
      "But if you tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God; ’ isn’t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?’\n",
      "Now therefore, please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.\n",
      "How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?\n",
      "Have I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’”’”\n",
      "Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it. Don’t speak with us in the Jews’ language, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”\n",
      "But Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? Hasn’t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?”\n",
      "Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spoke, saying, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.\n",
      "Thus says the king, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand.\n",
      "Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”\n",
      "Don’t listen to Hezekiah.’ For thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone of you eat of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern;\n",
      "until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die. Don’t listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.”\n",
      "Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?\n",
      "Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?\n",
      "Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”\n",
      "But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.”\n",
      "Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, came with Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.\n",
      "When king Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.\n",
      "They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them.\n",
      "It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”\n",
      "So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.\n",
      "Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall tell your master, ‘Yahweh says, “Don’t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.\n",
      "Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”\n",
      "So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.\n",
      "When he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “Behold, he has come out to fight against you, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,\n",
      "‘Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, “Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.\n",

      "Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh’s house, and spread it before Yahweh.\n",
      "Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sit above the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.\n",
      "Incline your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see. Hear the words of Sennacherib, with which he has sent to defy the living God.\n",
      "Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,\n",
      "and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them.\n",
      "Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us, I beg you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, Yahweh, are God alone.”\n",
      "Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Yahweh says, the God of Israel, ‘Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard you.\n",
      "This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: “The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.\n",

      "By your messengers you have defied the Lord, and have said, ‘With the multitude of my chariots, I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees; and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field.\n",
      "I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.’\n",
      "Haven’t you heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now have I brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.\n",
      "Therefore their inhabitants were of small power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like grain blasted before it has grown up.\n",
      "But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me.\n",
      "Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.”\n",

      "That night, Yahweh’s angel went out, and struck one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.\n",
      "So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.\n",
      "As he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.\n",

      "Isaiah said, “This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?”\n",
      "Hezekiah answered, “It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. Nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.”\n",
      "Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.\n",
      "At that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.\n",
      "Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them.\n",
      "Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?” Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, even from Babylon.”\n",

      "He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.\n",
      "For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.\n",
      "He built altars in Yahweh’s house, of which Yahweh said, “I will put my name in Jerusalem.”\n",
      "He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of Yahweh’s house.\n",

      "He set the engraved image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Yahweh said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever;\n",

      "Yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,\n",
      "“Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols;\n",
      "therefore Yahweh says, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.\n",
      "I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.\n",

      "Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.\n",
      "He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in all the way of David his father, and didn’t turn aside to the right hand or to the left.\n",
      "In the eighteenth year of king Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to Yahweh’s house, saying,\n",
      "“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into Yahweh’s house, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people.\n",
      "Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and let them give it to the workmen who are in Yahweh’s house, to repair the breaches of the house,\n",
      "to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house.\n",
      "However there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.”\n",
      "Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in Yahweh’s house.” Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.\n",
      "Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of Yahweh’s house.”\n",
      "Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me.” Shaphan read it before the king.\n",
      "When the king had heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes.\n",
      "The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,\n",
      "“Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.”\n",
      "So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with her.\n",
      "She said to them, “Yahweh says, the God of Israel: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,\n",
      "“Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.\n",
      "Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.’”\n",
      "But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall tell him, “Yahweh says, the God of Israel: ‘Concerning the words which you have heard,\n",
      "because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, ’ says Yahweh.\n",
      "‘Therefore behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place.’”’” They brought back this message to the king.\n",
      "The king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.\n",
      "The king went up to Yahweh’s house, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "The king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant.\n",
      "The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of Yahweh’s temple all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the army of the sky, and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.\n",
      "He put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the army of the sky.\n",
      "He brought out the Asherah from Yahweh’s house, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the graves of the common people.\n",
      "He broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were in Yahweh’s house, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.\n",
      "He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.\n",
      "Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn’t come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.\n",
      "He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.\n",
      "He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of Yahweh’s house, by the room of Nathan Melech the officer, who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.\n",
      "The king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of Yahweh’s house, and beat them down from there, and cast their dust into the brook Kidron.\n",
      "The king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon.\n",
      "He broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with the bones of men.\n",
      "Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.\n",
      "As Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to Yahweh’s word which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.\n",
      "Then he said, “What monument is that which I see?” The men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.”\n",
      "He said, “Let him be! Let no man move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.\n",
      "All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.\n",
      "He killed all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burned men’s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem.\n",
      "The king commanded all the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.”\n",
      "Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;\n",
      "but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this Passover kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Moreover Josiah removed those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "Like him was there no king before him, who turned to Yahweh with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.\n",
      "Notwithstanding, Yahweh didn’t turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked him.\n",
      "Yahweh said, “I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’”\n",

      "In his days Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and Pharaoh Necoh killed him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.\n",
      "His servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place.\n",
      "Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\n",

      "Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.\n",
      "Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.\n",
      "Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaoh Necoh.\n",

      "In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.\n",
      "Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to Yahweh’s word, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.\n",
      "Surely at the commandment of Yahweh came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,\n",
      "and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Yahweh would not pardon.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\n",
      "So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "The king of Egypt didn’t come again out of his land any more; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt.\n",
      "Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.\n",

      "At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.\n",
      "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it;\n",
      "and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.\n",
      "He carried out there all the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in Yahweh’s temple, as Yahweh had said.\n",
      "He carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; no one remained, except the poorest sort of the people of the land.\n",
      "He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.\n",
      "All the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.\n",
      "The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s father’s brother, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.\n",
      "Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\n",
      "He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.\n",
      "For through the anger of Yahweh, this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.\n",
      "In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it around it.\n",

      "On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.\n",
      "Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city around it); and the king went by the way of the Arabah.\n",
      "But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.\n",
      "Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him.\n",
      "They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.\n",
      "Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem.\n",
      "He burnt Yahweh’s house, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire.\n",
      "All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.\n",

      "On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.\n",
      "They stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to their idols, and to the people.\n",
      "They put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.\n",
      "When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,\n",
      "all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.\n",
      "So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh, because of Yahweh’s word, which he didn’t keep; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit, to inquire,\n",
      "and didn’t inquire of Yahweh: therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.\n",
      "Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.\n",
      "In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh your God said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.’”\n",
      "So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to Yahweh’s word by Samuel.\n",
      "David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (also called Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.\n",
      "The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You shall not come in here.” Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. The same is the city of David.\n",
      "David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.\n",
      "David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.\n",
      "He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.\n",
      "David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh of Armies was with him.\n",
      "Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to Yahweh’s word concerning Israel.\n",
      "This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.\n",
      "After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.\n",
      "He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.\n",
      "They stood in the middle of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory.\n",
      "Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.\n",
      "David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.\n",
      "David longed, and said, “Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”\n",
      "The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,\n",
      "and said, “My God forbid it me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.\n",
      "Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.\n",
      "Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: however he didn’t attain to the three.\n",
      "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the middle of a pit in time of snow.\n",
      "He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.\n",
      "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.\n",
      "Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three: and David set him over his guard.\n",
      "Also the mighty men of the armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,\n",

      "Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in war.\n",
      "They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow: they were of Saul’s brothers of Benjamin.\n",
      "The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,\n",

      "Of the Gadites there separated themselves to David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes on the mountains;\n",

      "There came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David.\n",
      "David went out to meet them, and answered them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see this and rebuke it.”\n",
      "Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, “We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.” Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.\n",
      "Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle; but they didn’t help them; for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, “He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.”\n",
      "As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh.\n",
      "They helped David against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army.\n",
      "For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of God.\n",
      "These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to Yahweh’s word.\n",

      "On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle, one hundred twenty thousand.\n",
      "All these being men of war, who could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.\n",
      "They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had made preparation for them.\n",
      "Moreover those who were near to them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and cattle, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel.\n",
      "David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.\n",
      "David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is of Yahweh our God, let us send abroad everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us;\n",
      "and let us bring again the ark of our God to us. For we didn’t seek it in the days of Saul.”\n",
      "All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.\n",
      "So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.\n",
      "David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits above the cherubim, that is called by the Name.\n",
      "They carried the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.\n",
      "David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.\n",
      "When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.\n",
      "Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Uzza, and he struck him, because he put out his hand to the ark; and there he died before God.\n",
      "David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken out against Uzza. He called that place Perez Uzza, to this day.\n",
      "David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?”\n",
      "So David didn’t move the ark to him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.\n",
      "The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months: and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had.\n",
      "Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.\n",
      "David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel’s sake.\n",
      "David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters.\n",
      "These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,\n",
      "and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,\n",
      "and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,\n",
      "and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.\n",
      "When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.\n",
      "Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.\n",
      "David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?” Yahweh said to him, “Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.”\n",
      "So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.\n",
      "They left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.\n",
      "The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.\n",
      "David inquired again of God; and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.\n",
      "It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”\n",
      "David did as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.\n",
      "The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.\n",
      "David made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.\n",
      "Then David said, “No one ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him forever.”\n",
      "David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up Yahweh’s ark to its place, which he had prepared for it.\n",
      "David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:\n",
      "of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty;\n",
      "of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty;\n",
      "of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty;\n",
      "of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;\n",
      "of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty;\n",
      "of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve.\n",
      "David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,\n",
      "and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.\n",
      "For because you didn’t carry it at first, Yahweh our God broke out in anger against us, because we didn’t seek him according to the ordinance.”\n",
      "So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "The children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the its poles, as Moses commanded according to Yahweh’s word.\n",
      "David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers, with instruments of music, stringed instruments and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.\n",
      "So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;\n",
      "and with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.\n",
      "So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud;\n",
      "and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;\n",
      "and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead.\n",
      "Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.\n",
      "Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.\n",
      "Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.\n",
      "So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.\n",
      "When God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.\n",
      "David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: and David had on him an ephod of linen.\n",
      "Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps.\n",
      "As the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.\n",
      "They brought in the ark of God, and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.\n",
      "When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in Yahweh’s name.\n",
      "He dealt to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.\n",
      "He appointed certain of the Levites to minister before Yahweh’s ark, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Yahweh, the God of Israel:\n",
      "Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;\n",
      "and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.\n",
      "Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.\n",
      "Oh give thanks to Yahweh. Call on his name. Make his doings known among the peoples.\n",
      "Sing to him. Sing praises to him. Tell of all his marvelous works.\n",
      "Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.\n",
      "Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his face forever more.\n",
      "Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,\n",
      "you offspring of Israel his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.\n",
      "He is Yahweh our God. His judgments are in all the earth.\n",
      "Remember his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,\n",
      "the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac.\n",
      "He confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,\n",
      "saying, “I will give you the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance, ”\n",
      "when you were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners were in it.\n",
      "They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.\n",
      "He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,\n",
      "“Don’t touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!”\n",
      "Sing to Yahweh, all the earth! Display his salvation from day to day.\n",
      "Declare his glory among the nations, and his marvelous works among all the peoples.\n",
      "For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised. He also is to be feared above all gods.\n",
      "For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens.\n",
      "Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and gladness are in his place.\n",
      "Ascribe to Yahweh, you relatives of the peoples, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength!\n",
      "Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come before him. Worship Yahweh in holy array.\n",
      "Tremble before him, all the earth. The world also is established that it can’t be moved.\n",
      "Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice! Let them say among the nations, “Yahweh reigns!”\n",
      "Let the sea roar, and its fullness! Let the field exult, and all that is therein!\n",
      "Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh, for he comes to judge the earth.\n",
      "Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.\n",
      "Say, “Save us, God of our salvation! Gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise.”\n",
      "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. All the people said, “Amen, ” and praised Yahweh.\n",
      "So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required;\n",
      "and Obed-Edom with their brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;\n",
      "and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before Yahweh’s tabernacle in the high place that was at Gibeon,\n",
      "to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in Yahweh’s law, which he commanded to Israel;\n",
      "and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his loving kindness endures forever;\n",
      "and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.\n",
      "All the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.\n",
      "When David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is under curtains.”\n",
      "Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.”\n",
      "That same night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying,\n",
      "“Go and tell David my servant, ‘Yahweh says, “You shall not build me a house to dwell in;\n",
      "for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another.\n",
      "In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’\n",

      "I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.\n",
      "I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,\n",
      "and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.\n",
      "It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your offspring after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.\n",
      "He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.\n",
      "I will be his father, and he shall be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you;\n",
      "but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne shall be established forever.”’”\n",
      "According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.\n",
      "Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?\n",
      "This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree, Yahweh God.\n",
      "What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant.\n",
      "Yahweh, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make known all these great things.\n",
      "Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.\n",
      "What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?\n",
      "For your people Israel you made your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.\n",
      "Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.\n",
      "Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.’\n",
      "For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.\n",
      "Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.\n",
      "Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”\n",
      "After this, David struck the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.\n",
      "He struck Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.\n",
      "David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.\n",
      "David took from him one thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.\n",
      "When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men.\n",
      "Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.\n",
      "David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.\n",
      "From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much brass, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.\n",
      "When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,\n",
      "he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him; (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou; ) and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and brass.\n",
      "King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.\n",
      "Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.\n",
      "He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.\n",
      "David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people.\n",
      "Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;\n",
      "and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;\n",
      "and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.\n",
      "After this, Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.\n",
      "But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?”\n",
      "So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.\n",
      "Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”\n",
      "When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.\n",
      "So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.\n",
      "When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.\n",
      "The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.\n",
      "Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.\n",
      "The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.\n",
      "He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.\n",
      "Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that which seems good to him.”\n",
      "So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.\n",
      "When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.\n",
      "When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and drew out the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head.\n",
      "It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came on them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.\n",
      "The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army.\n",
      "When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.\n",
      "At the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, Joab led out the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.\n",
      "David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set on David’s head: and he brought out the plunder of the city, exceeding much.\n",
      "He brought out the people who were therein, and cut them with saws, and with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.\n",
      "After this, there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.\n",
      "There was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.\n",
      "There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were twenty-four, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant.\n",
      "When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother killed him.\n",
      "These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.\n",
      "Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.\n",
      "David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.”\n",
      "Joab said, “May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?”\n",
      "Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.\n",
      "Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword.\n",
      "But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.\n",
      "God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.\n",
      "David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.”\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,\n",
      "“Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”\n",
      "So Gad came to David, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Take your choice:\n",
      "either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and Yahweh’s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.’”\n",
      "David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are very great. Let me not fall into the hand of man.”\n",
      "So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.\n",
      "God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough; now stay your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.\n",
      "David lifted up his eyes, and saw Yahweh’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.\n",
      "David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.”\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.\n",
      "David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yahweh’s name.\n",
      "Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.\n",
      "As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.\n",
      "Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”\n",
      "Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.”\n",
      "King David said to Ornan, “No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering without cost.”\n",
      "So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.\n",
      "David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.\n",
      "Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.\n",
      "At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.\n",
      "For Yahweh’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.\n",
      "But David couldn’t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of Yahweh’s angel.\n",
      "Then David said, “This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”\n",
      "David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut worked stones to build God’s house.\n",
      "David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;\n",
      "and cedar trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.\n",
      "David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David prepared abundantly before his death.\n",
      "Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "David said to Solomon his son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God.\n",
      "But Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ‘You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.\n",
      "Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.\n",
      "He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.’\n",
      "Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning you.\n",
      "May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.\n",
      "Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong, and courageous. Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.\n",
      "Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for Yahweh’s house one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them.\n",
      "There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work:\n",
      "of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be with you.”\n",
      "David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,\n",
      "“Isn’t Yahweh your God with you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and before his people.\n",
      "Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built for Yahweh’s name.”\n",
      "Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.\n",
      "He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.\n",
      "The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.\n",
      "David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of Yahweh’s house; six thousand were officers and judges;\n",
      "four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made, for giving praise.”\n",
      "David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n",
      "Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.\n",
      "The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.\n",
      "The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan.\n",
      "The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.\n",
      "Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.\n",
      "The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.\n",
      "The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever.\n",
      "But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.\n",
      "The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.\n",
      "The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.\n",
      "The sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.\n",
      "The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.\n",
      "The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.\n",
      "The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.\n",
      "The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.\n",
      "Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives.\n",
      "The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.\n",
      "These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of Yahweh’s house, from twenty years old and upward.\n",
      "For David said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.\n",
      "Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.”\n",
      "For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.\n",
      "For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of Yahweh’s house, in the courts, and in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of God’s house;\n",
      "for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all kinds of measure and size;\n",
      "and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening;\n",
      "and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh;\n",
      "and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, and the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service of Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.\n",
      "But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office.\n",
      "David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.\n",
      "There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight.\n",
      "Thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.\n",
      "Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.\n",
      "Now the first lot came out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,\n",
      "the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,\n",
      "the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,\n",
      "the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,\n",
      "the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,\n",
      "the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,\n",
      "the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,\n",
      "the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,\n",
      "the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,\n",
      "the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,\n",
      "the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,\n",
      "the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.\n",
      "This was their ordering in their service, to come into Yahweh’s house according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded him.\n",
      "Of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.\n",
      "Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.\n",
      "Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.\n",
      "The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.\n",
      "The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.\n",
      "The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.\n",
      "The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno.\n",
      "The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.\n",
      "Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.\n",
      "Of Kish; the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.\n",
      "The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers’ houses.\n",
      "These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; the fathers’ households of the chief even as those of his younger brother.\n",
      "Moreover, David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments, and with cymbals: and the number of those who did the work according to their service was:\n",
      "of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied after the order of the king.\n",
      "Of Jeduthun; the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh.\n",
      "Of Heman; the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.\n",
      "All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.\n",
      "All these were under the hands of their father for song in Yahweh’s house, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps, for the service of God’s house; Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king.\n",
      "The number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh, even all who were skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight.\n",
      "They cast lots for their offices, all alike, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.\n",
      "Now the first lot came out for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah; he and his brothers and sons were twelve:\n",
      "the third to Zaccur, his sons and his brothers, twelve:\n",
      "the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brothers, twelve:\n",
      "the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve:\n",
      "the sixth to Bukkiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve:\n",

      "Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, “Hear me, my brothers, and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building.\n",
      "But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.’\n",
      "However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.\n",
      "Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh’s kingdom over Israel.\n",
      "He said to me, ‘Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.\n",
      "I will establish his kingdom forever, if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at this day.’\n",
      "Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, Yahweh’s assembly, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.\n",
      "You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.\n",
      "Take heed now; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.”\n",
      "Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple, and of its houses, and of its treasuries, and of the upper rooms of it, and of the inner rooms of it, and of the place of the mercy seat;\n",
      "and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of Yahweh’s house, and for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of God’s house, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;\n",
      "also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of Yahweh’s house, and for all the vessels of service in Yahweh’s house;\n",
      "of gold by weight for the gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;\n",
      "by weight also for the lamp stands of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps; and for the lamp stands of silver, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps, according to the use of every lamp stand;\n",
      "and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;\n",
      "and the forks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;\n",
      "and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, the cherubim, that spread out, and covered the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.\n",
      "“All this”, said David, “I have been made to understand in writing from the hand of Yahweh, even all the works of this pattern.”\n",
      "David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed; for Yahweh God, even my God, is with you. He will not fail you, nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of Yahweh’s house is finished.\n",
      "Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of God’s house. There shall be with you in all kinds of work every willing man who has skill, for any kind of service. Also the captains and all the people will be entirely at your command.”\n",
      "David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God.\n",
      "Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for the things of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of various colors, and all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.\n",
      "In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,\n",
      "even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses;\n",
      "of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh?”\n",
      "Then the princes of the fathers’ households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly;\n",
      "and they gave for the service of God’s house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.\n",
      "They with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of Yahweh’s house, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.\n",
      "Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.\n",
      "Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, “You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.\n",
      "Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all.\n",
      "Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and it is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all.\n",
      "Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.\n",
      "But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.\n",
      "For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining.\n",
      "Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own.\n",
      "I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now have I seen with joy your people, that are present here, offer willingly to you.\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you;\n",
      "and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.”\n",
      "David said to all the assembly, “Now bless Yahweh your God!” All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king.\n",
      "They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,\n",
      "and ate and drink before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.\n",
      "Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.\n",
      "All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.\n",
      "Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and gave to him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.\n",
      "Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.\n",
      "The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.\n",
      "He died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,\n",
      "with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.\n",
      "Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Yahweh his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.\n",
      "Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ households.\n",
      "So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the Tent of Meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness.\n",
      "But David had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.\n",
      "Moreover the bronze altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before Yahweh’s tabernacle: and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there.\n",
      "Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the Tent of Meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it.\n",
      "In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask what I shall give you.”\n",
      "Solomon said to God, “You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place.\n",
      "Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.\n",
      "Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this your people, that is so great?”\n",
      "God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:\n",
      "wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you; neither shall any after you have the like.”\n",
      "So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.\n",
      "Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.\n",
      "The king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.\n",
      "The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue; the king’s merchants purchased them from Kue.\n",
      "They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means.\n",
      "Now Solomon decided to build a house for Yahweh’s name, and a house for his kingdom.\n",
      "Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.\n",
      "Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, “As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me.\n",
      "Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel.\n",
      "“The house which I build is great; for our God is great above all gods.\n",
      "But who is able to build him a house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense before him?\n",
      "“Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.\n",
      "“Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and behold, my servants shall be with your servants,\n",
      "even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.\n",
      "Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.”\n",
      "Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, “Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them.”\n",
      "Huram continued, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.\n",
      "Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, of Huram my father’s,\n",
      "the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any kind of engraving, and to devise any device; that there may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.\n",
      "“Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants:\n",
      "and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.”\n",
      "Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.\n",
      "He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work.\n",
      "Then Solomon began to build Yahweh’s house at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh appeared to David his father, which he prepared in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.\n",
      "He began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.\n",
      "Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God’s house. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.\n",
      "The porch that was in front, its length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.\n",
      "The greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains.\n",
      "He garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.\n",
      "He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls.\n",
      "He made the most holy house: its length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.\n",
      "The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper rooms with gold.\n",
      "In the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.\n",
      "The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.\n",
      "The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, joining to the wing of the other cherub.\n",
      "The wings of these cherubim spread themselves out twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.\n",
      "He made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim.\n",
      "Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.\n",
      "He made chains in the oracle, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.\n",
      "He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.\n",
      "Then he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height.\n",
      "Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it.\n",
      "Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.\n",
      "It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.\n",
      "It was a hand breadth thick; and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.\n",
      "He made also ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.\n",
      "He made the ten lamp stands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.\n",
      "He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. He made one hundred basins of gold.\n",
      "Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with brass.\n",
      "He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.\n",
      "Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God’s house:\n",
      "the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,\n",
      "and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.\n",
      "He made also the bases, and the basins made he on the bases;\n",
      "one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.\n",
      "Huram his father also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for king Solomon for Yahweh’s house of bright brass.\n",
      "The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.\n",
      "Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.\n",
      "Solomon made all the vessels that were in God’s house, the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them;\n",
      "and the lamp stands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;\n",
      "and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;\n",
      "and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold.\n",
      "Thus all the work that Solomon did for Yahweh’s house was finished. Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.\n",
      "Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion.\n",
      "And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month.\n",
      "All the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;\n",
      "and they brought up the ark, and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these the priests the Levites brought up.\n",
      "King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.\n",
      "The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.\n",
      "For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above.\n",
      "The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there it is to this day.\n",
      "There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.\n",
      "When the priests had come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and didn’t keep their divisions;\n",
      "also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets; )\n",
      "when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, saying, “For he is good; for his loving kindness endures forever!” then the house was filled with a cloud, even Yahweh’s house,\n",
      "so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for Yahweh’s glory filled God’s house.\n",
      "Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.\n",
      "But I have built you a house of habitation, and a place for you to dwell in forever.”\n",
      "The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.\n",
      "He said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying,\n",
      "‘Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:\n",
      "but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’\n",
      "Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "But Yahweh said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart:\n",
      "nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.’\n",
      "“Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "There I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with the children of Israel.”\n",
      "He stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands\n",
      "(for Solomon had made a bronze scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court; and on it he stood, and kneeled down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven; )\n",
      "and he said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven, or on earth; you who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;\n",
      "who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him: yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.\n",
      "“Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.’\n",
      "Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David.\n",
      "“But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain you; how much less this house which I have built!\n",
      "Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you;\n",
      "that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place.\n",
      "Listen to the petitions of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yes, hear from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive.\n",
      "“If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house;\n",
      "then hear from heaven, and do, and judge your servants, bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring his way on his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.\n",
      "“If your people Israel be struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall turn again and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house;\n",
      "then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.\n",
      "“When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:\n",
      "then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.\n",
      "“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is;\n",
      "whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread out his hands toward this house:\n",
      "then hear from heaven, your dwelling place and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of the children of men; )\n",
      "that they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.\n",
      "“Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for your great name’s sake, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:\n",
      "then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.\n",
      "“If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name;\n",
      "then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.\n",
      "“If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn’t sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near;\n",
      "yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly; ’\n",
      "if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:\n",
      "then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.\n",
      "“Now, my God, let, I beg you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.\n",
      "“Now therefore arise, Yahweh God, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, Yahweh God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness.\n",
      "“Yahweh God, don’t turn away the face of your anointed. Remember your loving kindnesses to David your servant.”\n",
      "Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and Yahweh’s glory filled the house.\n",
      "The priests could not enter into Yahweh’s house, because Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and Yahweh’s glory was on the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, saying, “For he is good; for his loving kindness endures for ever.”\n",
      "Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Yahweh.\n",
      "King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated God’s house.\n",
      "The priests stood, according to their positions; the Levites also with instruments of music of Yahweh, which David the king had made to give thanks to Yahweh, when David praised by their ministry, saying “For his loving kindness endures for ever.” The priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.\n",
      "Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court holy that was before Yahweh’s house; for there he offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat.\n",
      "So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.\n",
      "On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.\n",
      "On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.\n",
      "Thus Solomon finished Yahweh’s house, and the king’s house: and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in Yahweh’s house, and in his own house.\n",
      "Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, “I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for myself for a house of sacrifice.\n",
      "“If I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;\n",
      "if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\n",
      "Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.\n",
      "For now have I chosen and made this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.\n",
      "“As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances;\n",
      "then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.’\n",
      "But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;\n",
      "then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.\n",
      "This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, ‘Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?’\n",
      "They shall answer, ‘Because they abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and took other gods, worshiped them, and served them. Therefore he has brought all this evil on them.’”\n",
      "At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built Yahweh’s house, and his own house,\n",
      "the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.\n",
      "Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it.\n",
      "He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Hamath.\n",
      "Also he built Beth Horon the upper, and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;\n",
      "and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.\n",
      "As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel;\n",
      "of their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel didn’t consume, of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day.\n",
      "But of the children of Israel, Solomon made no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.\n",
      "These were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people.\n",
      "Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her; for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where Yahweh’s ark has come are holy.”\n",
      "Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh, which he had built before the porch,\n",
      "even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tents.\n",
      "He appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.\n",
      "They didn’t depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.\n",
      "Now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of Yahweh’s house, and until it was finished. So Yahweh’s house was completed.\n",
      "Then went Solomon to Ezion Geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.\n",
      "Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and brought from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.\n",
      "When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart.\n",
      "Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hidden from Solomon which he didn’t tell her.\n",
      "When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,\n",
      "and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing, his cup bearers also, and their clothing, and his ascent by which he went up to Yahweh’s house; there was no more spirit in her.\n",
      "She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.\n",
      "However I didn’t believe their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: you exceed the fame that I heard.\n",
      "Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom.\n",
      "Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on his throne, to be king for Yahweh your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore made he you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.”\n",
      "She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.\n",
      "The servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.\n",
      "The king made of the algum trees terraces for Yahweh’s house, and for the king’s house, and harps and stringed instruments for the singers: and there were none like these seen before in the land of Judah.\n",
      "King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.\n",
      "Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,\n",
      "besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.\n",
      "King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler.\n",
      "He made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.\n",
      "Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.\n",
      "And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.\n",
      "Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.\n",
      "All king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.\n",
      "For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.\n",
      "So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.\n",
      "All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.\n",
      "They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.\n",
      "Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.\n",
      "He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.\n",
      "The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.\n",
      "They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, aren’t they written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?\n",
      "Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.\n",
      "Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.\n",
      "When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.\n",
      "They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,\n",
      "“Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.”\n",
      "He said to them, “Come again to me after three days.” The people departed.\n",
      "King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, “What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people?”\n",
      "They spoke to him, saying, “If you are kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”\n",
      "But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.\n",
      "He said to them, “What counsel do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’”\n",
      "The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us; ’ thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.\n",
      "Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’”\n",
      "So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.”\n",
      "The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam abandoned the counsel of the old men,\n",
      "and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”\n",
      "So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was brought about of God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n",
      "When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So all Israel departed to their tents.\n",
      "But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.\n",
      "Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.\n",
      "So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.\n",
      "When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.\n",
      "But Yahweh’s word came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,\n",
      "“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,\n",
      "‘Yahweh says, “You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers! Return every man to his house; for this thing is of me.”’” So they listened to Yahweh’s words, and returned from going against Jeroboam.\n",
      "Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.\n",
      "He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,\n",
      "Beth Zur, and Soco, and Adullam,\n",
      "and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,\n",
      "and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,\n",
      "and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.\n",
      "He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, and oil and wine.\n",
      "He put shields and spears in every city, and made them exceeding strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.\n",
      "The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.\n",
      "For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office to Yahweh;\n",
      "and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made.\n",
      "After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.\n",
      "So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.\n",
      "Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;\n",
      "and she bore him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.\n",
      "After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.\n",
      "Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)\n",
      "Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the prince among his brothers; for he intended to make him king.\n",
      "He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them food in abundance. He sought for them many wives.\n",
      "When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, he abandoned Yahweh’s law, and all Israel with him.\n",
      "In the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Yahweh,\n",
      "with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.\n",
      "He took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.\n",
      "Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Yahweh says, ‘You have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.’”\n",
      "Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, “Yahweh is righteous.”\n",
      "When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, Yahweh’s word came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.\n",
      "Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”\n",
      "So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house. He took it all away. He also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made.\n",
      "King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.\n",
      "It was so, that as often as the king entered into Yahweh’s house, the guard came and bore them, and brought them back into the guard room.\n",
      "When he humbled himself, the wrath of Yahweh turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things found.\n",
      "So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.\n",
      "He did that which was evil, because he didn’t set his heart to seek Yahweh.\n",
      "Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren’t they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the way of genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.\n",
      "Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.\n",
      "He reigned three years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.\n",
      "Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.\n",
      "Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:\n",
      "Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?\n",
      "Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.\n",
      "There were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender hearted, and could not withstand them.\n",
      "“Now you think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.\n",
      "Haven’t you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves after the ways of the peoples of other lands? so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, the same may be a priest of those who are no gods.\n",
      "“But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and we have priests ministering to Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:\n",
      "and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense. They also set the show bread in order on the pure table; and the lamp stand of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening: for we keep the instruction of Yahweh our God; but you have forsaken him.\n",
      "Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don’t fight against Yahweh, the God of your fathers; for you shall not prosper.”\n",
      "But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.\n",
      "When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.\n",
      "Then the men of Judah gave a shout. As the men of Judah shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.\n",
      "The children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.\n",
      "Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.\n",
      "Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.\n",
      "Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with its towns, and Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephron with its towns.\n",
      "Jeroboam didn’t recover strength again in the days of Abijah. Yahweh struck him, and he died.\n",
      "But Abijah grew mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.\n",
      "The rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.\n",
      "So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet ten years.\n",
      "Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God:\n",
      "for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles,\n",
      "and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.\n",
      "Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.\n",
      "He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest.\n",
      "For he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities, and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered.\n",
      "Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.\n",
      "There came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops, and three hundred chariots; and he came to Mareshah.\n",
      "Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.\n",
      "Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, there is no one besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you are our God. Don’t let man prevail against you.”\n",
      "So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.\n",
      "Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh, and before his army; and they carried away very much booty.\n",
      "They struck all the cities around Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came on them: and they plundered all the cities; for there was much plunder in them.\n",
      "They struck also the tents of livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.\n",
      "The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded:\n",
      "and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin! Yahweh is with you, while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.\n",
      "Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.\n",
      "But when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.\n",
      "In those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands.\n",
      "They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with all adversity.\n",
      "But you be strong, and don’t let your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.”\n",
      "When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of Yahweh, that was before the porch of Yahweh.\n",
      "He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who lived with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him.\n",
      "So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.\n",
      "They sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the plunder which they had brought, seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep.\n",
      "They entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;\n",
      "and that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.\n",
      "They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.\n",
      "All Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and Yahweh gave them rest all around.\n",
      "Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.\n",
      "But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.\n",
      "He brought into God’s house the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.\n",
      "There was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.\n",
      "In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.\n",
      "Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of Yahweh’s house and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,\n",
      "“Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.”\n",
      "Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.\n",
      "When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease.\n",
      "Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.\n",
      "At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.\n",
      "Weren’t the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand.\n",
      "For the eyes of Yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly; for from henceforth you shall have wars.”\n",
      "Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.\n",
      "Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.\n",
      "In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he didn’t seek Yahweh, but to the physicians.\n",
      "Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.\n",
      "They buried him in his own tombs, which he had dug out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.\n",
      "He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.\n",
      "Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn’t seek the Baals,\n",
      "but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance.\n",
      "His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah.\n",
      "Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;\n",
      "and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.\n",
      "They taught in Judah, having the book of Yahweh’s law with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.\n",
      "The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.\n",
      "Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.\n",
      "He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.\n",
      "This was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;\n",
      "and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;\n",
      "and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.\n",
      "Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;\n",
      "and next to him Jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready prepared for war.\n",
      "These were those who waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.\n",
      "Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab.\n",
      "After certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead.\n",
      "Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?” He answered him, “I am as you are, and my people as your people. We will be with you in the war.”\n",
      "Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for Yahweh’s word.”\n",
      "Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” They said, “Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.”\n",
      "But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of him?”\n",
      "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla.” Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.”\n",
      "Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, “Get Micaiah the son of Imla quickly.”\n",
      "Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.\n",
      "Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘With these you shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’”\n",
      "All the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.”\n",
      "The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Let your word therefore, please be like one of theirs, and speak good.”\n",
      "Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, what my God says, that will I speak.”\n",
      "When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” He said, “Go up, and prosper. They shall be delivered into your hand.”\n",
      "The king said to him, “How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in Yahweh’s name?”\n",
      "He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh said, ‘These have no master. Let them return every man to his house in peace.’”\n",
      "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”\n",
      "Micaiah said, “Therefore hear Yahweh’s word: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.\n",
      "Yahweh said, ‘Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ One spoke saying in this way, and another saying in that way.\n",
      "A spirit came out, stood before Yahweh, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ “Yahweh said to him, ‘How?’\n",
      "“He said, ‘I will go, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ “He said, ‘You will entice him, and will prevail also. Go and do so.’\n",
      "“Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.”\n",
      "Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did Yahweh’s Spirit go from me to speak to you?”\n",
      "Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day, when you shall go into an inner room to hide yourself.”\n",
      "The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;\n",
      "and say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.”’”\n",
      "Micaiah said, “If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.” He said, “Listen, you peoples, all of you!”\n",
      "So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.\n",
      "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.\n",
      "Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, “Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.”\n",
      "When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel!” Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and Yahweh helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.\n",
      "When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.\n",
      "A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, “Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded.”\n",
      "The battle increased that day. However the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening; and about the time of the going down of the sun, he died.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.\n",
      "Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked, and love those who hate Yahweh? Because of this, wrath is on you from before Yahweh.\n",
      "Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God.”\n",
      "Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.\n",
      "He set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,\n",
      "and said to the judges, “Consider what you do: for you don’t judge for man, but for Yahweh; and he is with you in the judgment.\n",
      "Now therefore let the fear of Yahweh be on you. Take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Yahweh our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.”\n",
      "Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests, and of the heads of the fathers’ households of Israel, for the judgment of Yahweh, and for controversies. They returned to Jerusalem.\n",
      "He commanded them, saying, “Thus you shall do in the fear of Yahweh, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.\n",
      "Whenever any controversy shall come to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you shall warn them, that they not be guilty towards Yahweh, and so wrath come on you and on your brothers. Do this, and you shall not be guilty.\n",
      "Behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Yahweh; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king’s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and may Yahweh be with the good.”\n",
      "After this, the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.\n",
      "Then some came who told Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Syria. Behold, they are in Hazazon Tamar” (that is, En Gedi).\n",
      "Jehoshaphat was alarmed, and set himself to seek to Yahweh. He proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.\n",
      "Judah gathered themselves together, to seek help from Yahweh. They came out of all the cities of Judah to seek Yahweh.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in Yahweh’s house, before the new court;\n",
      "and he said, “Yahweh, the God of our fathers, aren’t you God in heaven? Aren’t you ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in your hand, so that no one is able to withstand you.\n",
      "Didn’t you, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it to the offspring of Abraham your friend forever?\n",
      "They lived in it, and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name, saying,\n",
      "‘If evil comes on us—the sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this house, and before you, (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.’\n",
      "Now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and didn’t destroy them;\n",
      "behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.\n",
      "Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us; neither know we what to do, but our eyes are on you.”\n",
      "All Judah stood before Yahweh, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s Spirit came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, in the middle of the assembly;\n",
      "and he said, “Listen, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you king Jehoshaphat. Yahweh says to you, ‘Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.\n",
      "Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz. You shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.\n",
      "You will not need to fight this battle. Set yourselves, stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Go out against them tomorrow, for Yahweh is with you.’”\n",
      "Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Yahweh, worshiping Yahweh.\n",
      "The Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Yahweh, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.\n",
      "They rose early in the morning, and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in Yahweh your God, so you shall be established! Believe his prophets, so you shall prosper.”\n",
      "When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who should sing to Yahweh, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks to Yahweh; for his loving kindness endures forever.\n",
      "When they began to sing and to praise, Yahweh set ambushers against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were struck.\n",
      "For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to kill and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy another.\n",
      "When Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were no one who escaped.\n",
      "When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their plunder, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in taking the plunder, it was so much.\n",
      "On the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Yahweh: therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day.\n",
      "Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in their forefront, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies.\n",
      "They came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets to Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel.\n",
      "So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest all around.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.\n",
      "He walked in the way of Asa his father, and didn’t turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh.\n",
      "However the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.\n",
      "After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. The same did very wickedly:\n",
      "and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion Geber.\n",
      "Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, Yahweh has destroyed your works.” The ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.\n",
      "Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.\n",
      "Their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.\n",
      "Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and various also of the princes of Israel.\n",
      "Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.\n",
      "He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.\n",
      "However Yahweh would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always.\n",
      "In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.\n",
      "Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, along with the captains of the chariots.\n",
      "So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day: then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Yahweh, the God of his fathers.\n",
      "Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute, and led Judah astray.\n",
      "A letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, “Yahweh says, the God of David your father, ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,\n",
      "but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute, like the house of Ahab did, and also have slain your brothers of your father’s house, who were better than yourself:\n",
      "behold, Yahweh will strike with a great plague your people, and your children, and your wives, and all your substance;\n",
      "and you shall have great sickness by disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.’”\n",
      "Yahweh stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians:\n",
      "and they came up against Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.\n",
      "After all this Yahweh struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease.\n",
      "In process of time, at the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of severe diseases. His people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.\n",
      "Thirty-two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.\n",
      "The inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place; for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.\n",
      "Forty-two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.\n",
      "He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.\n",
      "He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.\n",
      "He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.\n",
      "He returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.\n",
      "Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram: for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.\n",
      "When Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, serving Ahaziah, and killed them.\n",
      "He sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and killed him; and they buried him, for they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his heart.” The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.\n",
      "Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah.\n",
      "But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she didn’t kill him.\n",
      "He was with them hidden in God’s house six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.\n",
      "In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.\n",
      "They went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers’ households of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.\n",
      "All the assembly made a covenant with the king in God’s house. He said to them, “Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David.\n",
      "This is the thing that you shall do. A third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds.\n",
      "A third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation. All the people shall be in the courts of Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "But let no one come into Yahweh’s house, except the priests, and those who minister of the Levites. They shall come in, for they are holy, but all the people shall follow Yahweh’s instructions.\n",
      "The Levites shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand. Whoever comes into the house, let him be slain. Be with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out.”\n",
      "So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest didn’t dismiss the shift.\n",
      "Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David’s, which were in God’s house.\n",
      "He set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king.\n",
      "Then they brought out the king’s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony, and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said, “Long live the king!”\n",
      "When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into Yahweh’s house:\n",
      "and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets; the singers also played musical instruments, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, “Treason! treason!”\n",
      "Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t kill her in the Yahweh’s house.”\n",
      "So they made way for her. She went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king’s house; and they killed her there.\n",
      "Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Yahweh’s people.\n",
      "All the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.\n",
      "Jehoiada appointed the officers of Yahweh’s house under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in Yahweh’s house, to offer the burnt offerings of Yahweh, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.\n",
      "He set the porters at the gates of Yahweh’s house, that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in.\n",
      "He took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from Yahweh’s house: and they came through the upper gate to the king’s house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom.\n",
      "So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had slain with the sword.\n",
      "Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zibiah, of Beersheba.\n",
      "Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest.\n",
      "Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he became the father of sons and daughters.\n",
      "After this, Joash intended to restore Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "He gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to year. See that you expedite this matter.” However the Levites didn’t do it right away.\n",
      "The king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, “Why haven’t you required of the Levites to bring in the tax of Moses the servant of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel, out of Judah and out of Jerusalem, for the tent of the testimony?”\n",
      "For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up God’s house; and they also gave all the dedicated things of Yahweh’s house to the Baals.\n",
      "So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "They made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.\n",
      "All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.\n",
      "It was so, that whenever the chest was brought to the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.\n",
      "The king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of Yahweh’s house; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore Yahweh’s house, and also such as worked iron and brass to repair Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "So the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up God’s house in its state, and strengthened it.\n",
      "When they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for Yahweh’s house, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. They offered burnt offerings in Yahweh’s house continually all the days of Jehoiada.\n",
      "But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died; one hundred thirty years old was he when he died.\n",
      "They buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.\n",
      "Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.\n",
      "They abandoned the house of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherah poles and the idols; and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.\n",
      "Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to Yahweh; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.\n",
      "The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them, “Thus says God, ‘Why do you disobey Yahweh’s commandments, so that you can’t prosper? Because you have forsaken Yahweh, he has also forsaken you.’”\n",
      "They conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "Thus Joash the king didn’t remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. When he died, he said, “May Yahweh look at it, and repay it.”\n",
      "At the end of the year, the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all their plunder to the king of Damascus.\n",
      "For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment on Joash.\n",
      "When they were departed for him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they didn’t bury him in the tombs of the kings.\n",
      "These are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.\n",
      "Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid on him, and the rebuilding of God’s house, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. Amaziah his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.\n",
      "He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, but not with a perfect heart.\n",
      "Now when the kingdom was established to him, he killed his servants who had killed the king his father.\n",
      "But he didn’t put their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.”\n",
      "Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers’ houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go out to war, who could handle spear and shield.\n",
      "He hired also one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver.\n",
      "A man of God came to him, saying, “O king, don’t let the army of Israel go with you; for Yahweh is not with Israel, with all the children of Ephraim.\n",
      "But if you will go, take action, be strong for the battle. God will overthrow you before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to overthrow.”\n",
      "Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?” The man of God answered, “Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.”\n",
      "Then Amaziah separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.\n",
      "Amaziah took courage, and led his people out, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir.\n",
      "The children of Judah carried away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and threw them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.\n",
      "But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much plunder.\n",
      "Now after Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, “Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?”\n",
      "As he talked with him, the king said to him, “Have we made you one of the king’s counselors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?” Then the prophet stopped, and said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel.”\n",
      "Then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in the face.”\n",
      "Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as his wife; then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle.\n",
      "You say to yourself that you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast. Now stay at home. Why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?’”\n",
      "But Amaziah would not listen; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.\n",
      "So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.\n",
      "Judah was defeated by Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.\n",
      "Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.\n",
      "He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in God’s house with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.\n",
      "Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren’t they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?\n",
      "Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.\n",
      "They brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.\n",
      "All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.\n",
      "He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.\n",
      "Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.\n",
      "He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.\n",
      "He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought Yahweh, God made him to prosper.\n",
      "He went out and fought against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines.\n",
      "God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunim.\n",
      "The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he grew exceeding strong.\n",
      "Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.\n",
      "He built towers in the wilderness, and dug out many cisterns, for he had much livestock; in the lowland also, and in the plain: and he had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved farming.\n",
      "Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, who went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains.\n",
      "The whole number of the heads of fathers’ households, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.\n",
      "Under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.\n",
      "Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.\n",
      "He made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, until he was strong.\n",
      "But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Yahweh his God; for he went into Yahweh’s temple to burn incense on the altar of incense.\n",
      "Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men:\n",
      "and they resisted Uzziah the king, and said to him, “It isn’t for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall it be for your honor from Yahweh God.”\n",
      "Then Uzziah was angry; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in Yahweh’s house, beside the altar of incense.\n",
      "Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from there; yes, himself hurried also to go out, because Yahweh had struck him.\n",
      "Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from Yahweh’s house: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote.\n",
      "So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, “He is a leper.” Jotham his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.\n",
      "He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had done: however he didn’t enter into Yahweh’s temple. The people still did corruptly.\n",
      "He built the upper gate of Yahweh’s house, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.\n",
      "Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.\n",
      "He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The children of Ammon gave that much to him in the second year also, and in the third.\n",
      "So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.\n",
      "He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he didn’t do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, like David his father;\n",
      "but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baals.\n",
      "Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.\n",
      "He sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they struck him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. He was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with a great slaughter.\n",
      "For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers.\n",
      "Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king.\n",
      "The children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much plunder from them, and brought the plunder to Samaria.\n",
      "But a prophet of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, “Behold, because Yahweh, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.\n",
      "Now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for male and female slaves for yourselves. Aren’t there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God?\n",
      "Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that you have taken captive from your brothers; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you.”\n",
      "Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,\n",
      "and said to them, “You shall not bring in the captives here: for you purpose that which will bring on us a trespass against Yahweh, to add to our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.”\n",
      "So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the princes and all the assembly.\n",
      "The men who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the plunder clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them, gave them sandals, and gave them something to eat and to drink, anointed them, carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria.\n",
      "At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.\n",
      "For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and carried away captives.\n",
      "The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with its towns, and Timnah with its towns, Gimzo also and its towns: and they lived there.\n",
      "For Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed severely against Yahweh.\n",
      "Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but didn’t strengthen him.\n",
      "For Ahaz took away a portion out of Yahweh’s house, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria: but it didn’t help him.\n",
      "In the time of his distress, he trespassed yet more against Yahweh, this same king Ahaz.\n",
      "For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him; and he said, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, so I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.\n",
      "Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God’s house, and cut in pieces the vessels of God’s house, and shut up the doors of Yahweh’s house; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.\n",
      "In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of his fathers.\n",
      "Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.\n",
      "Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they didn’t bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.\n",
      "He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done.\n",
      "He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of Yahweh’s house, and repaired them.\n",
      "He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,\n",
      "and said to them, “Listen to me, you Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify Yahweh’s house, the God of your fathers, and carry out the filthiness out of the holy place.\n",
      "For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh, and turned their backs.\n",
      "Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.\n",
      "Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to be tossed back and forth, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.\n",
      "For, behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.\n",
      "Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.\n",
      "My sons, don’t be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him, to minister to him, and that you should be his ministers, and burn incense.”\n",
      "Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;\n",
      "and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;\n",
      "and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.\n",
      "They gathered their brothers, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by Yahweh’s words, to cleanse Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "The priests went in to the inner part of Yahweh’s house, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in Yahweh’s temple into the court of Yahweh’s house. The Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.\n",
      "Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Yahweh; and they sanctified Yahweh’s house in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.\n",
      "Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, “We have cleansed all Yahweh’s house, and the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and the table of show bread, with all its vessels.\n",
      "Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign threw away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and behold, they are before the altar of Yahweh.”\n",
      "Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "They brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. He commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Yahweh.\n",
      "So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.\n",
      "They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them:\n",
      "and the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.\n",
      "He set the Levites in Yahweh’s house with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Yahweh by his prophets.\n",
      "The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.\n",
      "Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of Yahweh began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.\n",
      "All the assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.\n",
      "When they had made an end of offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.\n",
      "Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.\n",
      "Then Hezekiah answered, “Now you have consecrated yourselves to Yahweh; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into Yahweh’s house.” The assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.\n",
      "The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh.\n",
      "The consecrated things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep.\n",
      "But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: therefore their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.\n",
      "Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of Yahweh’s house was set in order.\n",
      "Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.\n",
      "Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to Yahweh’s house at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month.\n",
      "For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.\n",
      "The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.\n",
      "So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.\n",
      "So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, “You children of Israel, turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that have escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.\n",
      "Don’t be like your fathers, and like your brothers, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as you see.\n",
      "Now don’t be stiff-necked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves to Yahweh, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve Yahweh your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.\n",
      "For if you turn again to Yahweh, your brothers and your children shall find compassion before those who led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him.”\n",
      "So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun: but they ridiculed them, and mocked them.\n",
      "Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.\n",
      "Also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by Yahweh’s word.\n",
      "Many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.\n",
      "They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.\n",
      "Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.\n",
      "For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Yahweh.\n",
      "For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “May the good Yahweh pardon everyone\n",
      "who sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, even if they aren’t clean according to the purification of the sanctuary.”\n",
      "Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.\n",
      "The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day, singing with loud instruments to Yahweh.\n",
      "Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Yahweh. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.\n",
      "The whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept another seven days with gladness.\n",
      "For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.\n",
      "All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.\n",
      "So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.\n",
      "Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.\n",
      "Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Yahweh.\n",
      "He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in Yahweh’s law.\n",
      "Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to Yahweh’s law.\n",
      "As soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.\n",
      "The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God, and laid them by heaps.\n",
      "In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.\n",
      "When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh, and his people Israel.\n",
      "Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.\n",
      "Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, “Since people began to bring the offerings into Yahweh’s house, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Yahweh has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.”\n",
      "Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in Yahweh’s house; and they prepared them.\n",
      "They brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.\n",
      "Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of God’s house.\n",
      "Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the offerings of Yahweh, and the most holy things.\n",
      "Under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, as well to the great as to the small:\n",
      "besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into Yahweh’s house, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions;\n",
      "and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers’ houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions;\n",
      "and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.\n",
      "Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.\n",
      "Hezekiah did so throughout all Judah; and he worked that which was good and right and faithful before Yahweh his God.\n",
      "In every work that he began in the service of God’s house, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.\n",
      "After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.\n",
      "When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,\n",
      "he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city; and they helped him.\n",
      "So many people gathered together, and they stopped all the springs, and the brook that flowed through the middle of the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?”\n",
      "He took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.\n",
      "He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,\n",
      "“Be strong and courageous, don’t be afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him.\n",
      "With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Yahweh our God to help us, and to fight our battles.” The people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.\n",
      "After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying,\n",
      "Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, “In whom do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem?\n",
      "Doesn’t Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, ‘Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?’\n",
      "Hasn’t the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You shall worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn incense?’\n",
      "Don’t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand?\n",
      "Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?\n",
      "Now therefore don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this way, neither believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand?”\n",
      "His servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God, and against his servant Hezekiah.\n",
      "He also wrote letters insulting Yahweh, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand.”\n",
      "They cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.\n",
      "They spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands.\n",
      "Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.\n",
      "Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. When he had come into the house of his god, those who came out of his own bowels killed him there with the sword.\n",
      "Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.\n",
      "Many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.\n",
      "In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death: and he prayed to Yahweh; and he spoke to him, and gave him a sign.\n",
      "But Hezekiah didn’t render again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem.\n",
      "Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Yahweh didn’t come on them in the days of Hezekiah.\n",
      "Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all kinds of goodly vessels;\n",
      "storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all kinds of animals, and flocks in folds.\n",
      "Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.\n",
      "This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.\n",
      "However concerning the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.\n",
      "Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.\n",
      "He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.\n",
      "For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baals, and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.\n",
      "He built altars in Yahweh’s house, of which Yahweh said, “My name shall be in Jerusalem forever.”\n",
      "He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and practiced sorcery, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.\n",
      "He set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made, in God’s house, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever:\n",
      "neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Moses.”\n",
      "Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil than the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel did.\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.\n",
      "When he was in distress, he begged Yahweh his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.\n",
      "He prayed to him; and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God.\n",
      "Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he encircled Ophel with it, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.\n",
      "He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of Yahweh’s house, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of Yahweh’s house, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.\n",
      "He built up the altar of Yahweh, and offered sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving on it, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.\n",
      "His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherah poles and the engraved images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.\n",
      "So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.\n",
      "He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.\n",
      "He didn’t humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.\n",
      "His servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.\n",
      "But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.\n",
      "Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.\n",
      "He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in the ways of David his father, and didn’t turn aside to the right hand or to the left.\n",
      "For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherah poles, and the engraved images, and the molten images.\n",
      "They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and the incense altars that were on high above them he cut down; and the Asherah poles, and the engraved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.\n",
      "He burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.\n",
      "He did this in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins.\n",
      "He broke down the altars, and beat the Asherah poles and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.\n",
      "Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair Yahweh’s house his God.\n",
      "They came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into God’s house, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\n",
      "They delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and the workmen who labored in Yahweh’s house gave it to mend and repair the house;\n",
      "even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy cut stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.\n",
      "The men did the work faithfully: and their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and others of the Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music.\n",
      "Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all who did the work in every kind of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.\n",
      "When they brought out the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house, Hilkiah the priest found the book of Yahweh’s law given by Moses.\n",
      "Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in Yahweh’s house.” Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.\n",
      "Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, “All that was committed to your servants, they are doing.\n",
      "They have emptied out the money that was found in Yahweh’s house, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.”\n",
      "Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book.” Shaphan read therein before the king.\n",
      "When the king had heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes.\n",
      "The king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,\n",
      "“Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept Yahweh’s word, to do according to all that is written in this book.”\n",
      "So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter; ) and they spoke to her to that effect.\n",
      "She said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,\n",
      "“Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.\n",
      "Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place, and it shall not be quenched.’”’\n",
      "But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall tell him, ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says: “As touching the words which you have heard,\n",
      "because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, ” says Yahweh.\n",
      "“Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this place, and on its inhabitants.”’” They brought back word to the king.\n",
      "Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.\n",
      "The king went up to Yahweh’s house, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.\n",
      "He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.\n",
      "Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they didn’t depart from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.\n",
      "Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem: and they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.\n",
      "He set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "He said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to Yahweh, “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built. There shall no more be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve Yahweh your God, and his people Israel.\n",
      "Prepare yourselves after your fathers’ houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.\n",
      "Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brothers the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a fathers’ house of the Levites.\n",
      "Kill the Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to Yahweh’s word by Moses.”\n",
      "Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and young goats, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls: these were of the king’s substance.\n",
      "His princes gave for a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of God’s house, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small livestock, and three hundred head of cattle.\n",
      "Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock, and five hundred head of cattle.\n",
      "So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king’s commandment.\n",
      "They killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.\n",
      "They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it is written in the book of Moses. So they did with the cattle.\n",
      "They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.\n",
      "Afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.\n",
      "The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters were at every gate: they didn’t need to depart from their service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.\n",
      "So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh, according to the commandment of king Josiah.\n",
      "The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.\n",
      "There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\n",
      "In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.\n",
      "After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.\n",
      "But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you this day, but against the house with which I have war. God has commanded me to make haste. Beware that it is God who is with me, that he not destroy you.”\n",
      "Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and didn’t listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.\n",
      "The archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, because I am seriously wounded!”\n",
      "So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.\n",
      "Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and behold, they are written in the lamentations.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in Yahweh’s law,\n",
      "and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.\n",
      "Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s place in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.\n",
      "The king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.\n",
      "The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.\n",
      "Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God.\n",
      "Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.\n",
      "Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of Yahweh’s house to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.\n",
      "Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.\n",
      "Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.\n",
      "At the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of Yahweh’s house, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.\n",
      "Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:\n",
      "and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God; he didn’t humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Yahweh.\n",
      "He also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted Yahweh’s house which he had made holy in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:\n",
      "but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Yahweh arose against his people, until there was no remedy.\n",
      "Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or gray-headed: he gave them all into his hand.\n",
      "All the vessels of God’s house, great and small, and the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.\n",
      "They burnt God’s house, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it.\n",
      "He carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:\n",
      "to fulfill Yahweh’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. As long as it lay desolate it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.\n",
      "Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that Yahweh’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,\n",
      "“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, Yahweh his God be with him, and let him go up.’”\n",
      "Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that Yahweh’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,\n",
      "“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.\n",
      "Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Whoever is left, in any place where he lives, let the men of his place help him with silver, with gold, with goods, and with animals, besides the freewill offering for God’s house which is in Jerusalem.’”\n",
      "Then the heads of fathers’ households of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build Yahweh’s house which is in Jerusalem.\n",
      "All those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with animals, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.\n",
      "Also Cyrus the king brought out the vessels of Yahweh’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;\n",
      "even those, Cyrus king of Persia brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.\n",
      "This is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, one thousand platters of silver, twenty-nine knives,\n",
      "thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels one thousand.\n",
      "All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. Sheshbazzar brought all these up, when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.\n",
      "Now these are the children of the province, who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his city;\n",
      "who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:\n",

      "so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard far away.\n",
      "Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to Yahweh, the God of Israel;\n",
      "then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’ households, and said to them, “Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as you do; and we sacrifice to him since the days of Esar Haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.”\n",
      "But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ households of Israel, said to them, “You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to Yahweh, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.”\n",
      "Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,\n",
      "and hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.\n",
      "In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.\n",
      "In the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian, and delivered in the Syrian language.\n",
      "Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:\n",
      "then Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,\n",
      "and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth, wrote.\n",
      "This is the copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king: Your servants the men beyond the River, and so forth.\n",
      "Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.\n",
      "Be it known now to the king that if this city is built, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings.\n",
      "Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not appropriate for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore have we sent and informed the king;\n",
      "that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so you shall find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.\n",
      "We inform the king that, if this city be built, and the walls finished, by this means you shall have no portion beyond the River.\n",
      "Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.\n",
      "The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.\n",
      "I decreed, and search has been made, and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.\n",
      "There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid to them.\n",
      "Make a decree now to cause these men to cease, and that this city not be built, until a decree shall be made by me.\n",
      "Take heed that you not be slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?\n",
      "Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.\n",
      "Then ceased the work of God’s house which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.\n",
      "Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel they prophesied to them.\n",
      "Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build God’s house which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.\n",
      "At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shetharbozenai, and their companions, and said thus to them, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?”\n",
      "Then we told them in this way, what the names of the men were who were making this building.\n",
      "But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, until the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.\n",
      "The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shetharbozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king;\n",
      "they sent a letter to him, in which was written thus: To Darius the king, all peace.\n",
      "Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands.\n",
      "Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?”\n",
      "We asked them their names also, to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head.\n",
      "Thus they returned us answer, saying, “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.\n",
      "But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.\n",
      "But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.\n",
      "The gold and silver vessels also of God’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;\n",
      "and he said to him, ‘Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let God’s house be built in its place.’\n",
      "Then the same Sheshbazzar came, and laid the foundations of God’s house which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now has it been in building, and yet it is not completed.\n",
      "Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let a search be made in the king’s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.”\n",
      "Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.\n",
      "There was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a scroll, and therein was thus written for a record:\n",
      "In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning God’s house at Jerusalem, let the house be built, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be strongly laid; its height sixty cubits, and its breadth sixty cubits;\n",
      "with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house.\n",
      "Also let the gold and silver vessels of God’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, everyone to its place; and you shall put them in God’s house.\n",
      "Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, you must stay far from there.\n",
      "Leave the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.\n",
      "Moreover I make a decree what you shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence to these men, that they be not hindered.\n",
      "That which they have need of, both young bulls, and rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;\n",
      "that they may offer sacrifices of pleasant aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.\n",
      "Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened on it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:\n",
      "and the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who stretch out their hand to alter the same, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.\n",
      "Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and their companions, because Darius the king had sent a decree, did accordingly with all diligence.\n",
      "The elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.\n",
      "This house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.\n",
      "The children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.\n",
      "They offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.\n",
      "They set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.\n",
      "The children of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.\n",
      "For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.\n",
      "The children of Israel who had come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, ate,\n",
      "and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for Yahweh had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of God’s house, the God of Israel.\n",
      "Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,\n",
      "the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,\n",
      "the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,\n",
      "the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,\n",
      "the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest;\n",
      "this Ezra went up from Babylon: and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Yahweh his God on him.\n",
      "There went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.\n",
      "He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.\n",
      "For on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.\n",
      "For Ezra had set his heart to seek Yahweh’s law, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.\n",
      "Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of Yahweh’s commandments, and of his statutes to Israel:\n",
      "Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth.\n",
      "I make a decree, that all those of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with you.\n",
      "Because you are sent of the king and his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand,\n",
      "and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,\n",
      "and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;\n",
      "therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls, rams, lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do that after the will of your God.\n",
      "The vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem.\n",
      "Whatever more shall be needful for the house of your God, which you shall have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king’s treasure house.\n",
      "I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,\n",
      "to one hundred talents of silver, and to one hundred measures of wheat, and to one hundred baths of wine, and to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.\n",
      "Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?\n",
      "Also we inform you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, on them.\n",
      "You, Ezra, after the wisdom of your God who is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people who are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach him who doesn’t know them.\n",
      "Whoever will not do the law of your God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with all diligence, whether it is to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.\n",
      "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify Yahweh’s house which is in Jerusalem;\n",
      "and has extended loving kindness to me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. I was strengthened according to the hand of Yahweh my God on me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.\n",
      "Now these are the heads of their fathers’ households, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:\n",
      "Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom. Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hattush.\n",
      "Of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males one hundred fifty.\n",
      "Of the sons of Pahathmoab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males.\n",
      "Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males.\n",
      "Of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males.\n",
      "Of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males.\n",
      "Of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him eighty males.\n",
      "Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males.\n",
      "Of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him one hundred sixty males.\n",
      "Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty-eight males.\n",
      "Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him one hundred ten males.\n",
      "Of the sons of Adonikam, who were the last; and these are their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah; and with them sixty males.\n",
      "Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males.\n",
      "I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.\n",
      "Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.\n",
      "I sent them out to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should tell Iddo, and his brothers the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.\n",
      "According to the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;\n",
      "and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;\n",
      "and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name.\n",
      "Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.\n",
      "For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, “The hand of our God is on all those who seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all those who forsake him.”\n",
      "So we fasted and begged our God for this: and he was entreated of us.\n",
      "Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,\n",
      "and weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:\n",
      "I weighed into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels one hundred talents; of gold one hundred talents;\n",
      "and twenty bowls of gold, of one thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.\n",
      "I said to them, “You are holy to Yahweh, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh, the God of your fathers.\n",
      "Watch, and keep them, until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’ households of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the rooms of Yahweh’s house.”\n",
      "So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.\n",
      "Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the bandit by the way.\n",
      "We came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days.\n",
      "On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;\n",
      "the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time.\n",
      "The children of the captivity, who had come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering to Yahweh.\n",
      "They delivered the king’s commissions to the king’s satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they furthered the people and God’s house.\n",
      "Now when these things were done, the princes drew near to me, saying, “The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, following their abominations, even those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.\n",
      "For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy offspring have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands. Yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.”\n",
      "When I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.\n",
      "Then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of their trespass of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening offering.\n",
      "At the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn; and I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God;\n",
      "and I said, “My God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God; for our iniquities have increased over our head, and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens.\n",
      "Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty to this day; and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests, have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.\n",
      "Now for a little moment grace has been shown from Yahweh our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.\n",
      "For we are bondservants; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended loving kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.\n",
      "“Now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,\n",
      "which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness.\n",
      "Now therefore don’t give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever; that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.’\n",
      "“After all that has come on us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, since you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a remnant,\n",
      "shall we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? Wouldn’t you be angry with us until you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of Israel, you are righteous; for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is this day. Behold, we are before you in our guiltiness; for no one can stand before you because of this.”\n",
      "Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before God’s house, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very bitterly.\n",
      "Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered Ezra, “We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land. Yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.\n",
      "Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let it be done according to the law.\n",
      "Arise; for the matter belongs to you, and we are with you. Be courageous, and do it.”\n",
      "Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore.\n",
      "Then Ezra rose up from before God’s house, and went into the room of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came there, he ate no bread, nor drank water; for he mourned because of their trespass of the captivity.\n",
      "They made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;\n",
      "and that whoever didn’t come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.\n",
      "Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before God’s house, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.\n",
      "Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, “You have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.\n",
      "Now therefore make confession to Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.”\n",
      "Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, “As you have said concerning us, so must we do.\n",
      "But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside; neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.\n",
      "Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter is resolved.”\n",
      "Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.\n",
      "The children of the captivity did so. Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers’ households, after their fathers’ houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.\n",
      "They made an end with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.\n",
      "Among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women: of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.\n",
      "They gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt.\n",
      "Of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.\n",
      "Of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.\n",
      "Of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.\n",
      "Of the Levites: Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah (also called Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.\n",

      "Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.\n",
      "They said to me, “The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”\n",
      "When I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,\n",
      "and said, “I beg you, Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:\n",

Yes, I and my father’s house have sinned.\n",

      "Lord, I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” Now I was cup bearer to the king.\n",
      "In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad before in his presence.\n",
      "The king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart.” Then I was very much afraid.\n",
      "I said to the king, “Let the king live forever! Why shouldn’t my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?”\n",
      "Then the king said to me, “For what do you make request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven.\n",
      "I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may build it.”\n",

      "When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.\n",
      "So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.\n",
      "I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any animal with me, except the animal that I rode on.\n",
      "I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal’s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire.\n",

      "I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me, as also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me. They said, “Let’s rise up and build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work.\n",
      "But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us, and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”\n",
      "Then answered I them, and said to them, “The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, his servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.”\n",
      "Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up its doors; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananel.\n",

      "Palal the son of Uzai made repairs opposite the turning of the wall, and the tower that stands out from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs.\n",
      "(Now the Nethinim lived in Ophel, to the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that stands out.)\n",
      "After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower that stands out, and to the wall of Ophel.\n",
      "Above the horse gate, the priests made repairs, everyone across from his own house.\n",
      "After them, Zadok the son of Immer made repairs across from his own house. After him, Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate made repairs.\n",

      "Between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs.\n",
      "But when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.\n",
      "He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, since they are burned?”\n",
      "Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, “What they are building, if a fox climbed up it, he would break down their stone wall.”\n",
      "“Hear, our God; for we are despised; and turn back their reproach on their own head, give them up for a plunder in a land of captivity;\n",
      "don’t cover their iniquity, and don’t let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they have insulted the builders.”\n",
      "So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height: for the people had a mind to work.\n",
      "But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be filled, then they were very angry;\n",
      "and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.\n",
      "But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.\n",
      "Judah said, “The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.”\n",
      "Our adversaries said, “They shall not know, neither see, until we come in among them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.”\n",
      "When the Jews who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”\n",
      "Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.\n",
      "I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them! Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”\n",
      "When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work.\n",
      "From that time forth, half of my servants worked in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.\n",
      "They all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other held his weapon;\n",
      "and the builders, everyone wore his sword at his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was by me.\n",
      "I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another.\n",
      "Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally there to us. Our God will fight for us.”\n",
      "So we worked in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.\n",
      "Likewise at the same time said I to the people, “Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.”\n",
      "So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes. Everyone took his weapon to the water.\n",
      "Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.\n",
      "For there were that said, “We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain, that we may eat and live.”\n",
      "Some also there were that said, “We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain, because of the famine.”\n",
      "There were also some who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral.\n",
      "Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children. Behold, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters have been brought into bondage. Neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.”\n",
      "I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.\n",
      "Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, “You exact usury, everyone of his brother.” I held a great assembly against them.\n",
      "I said to them, “We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us?” Then they held their peace, and found never a word.\n",
      "Also I said, “The thing that you do is not good. Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?\n",
      "I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. Please let us stop this usury.\n",
      "Please restore to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them.”\n",
      "Then they said, “We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as you say.” Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.\n",
      "Also I shook out my lap, and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that doesn’t perform this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.” All the assembly said, “Amen, ” and praised Yahweh. The people did according to this promise.\n",
      "Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.\n",
      "But the former governors who were before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine from them, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants ruled over the people: but I didn’t do so, because of the fear of God.\n",
      "Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered there to the work.\n",
      "Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us.\n",
      "Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I didn’t demand the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy on this people.\n",
      "Remember to me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.\n",
      "Now when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates; )\n",
      "Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to harm me.\n",
      "I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that I can’t come down. Why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?”\n",
      "They sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them the same way.\n",
      "Then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,\n",
      "in which was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel. Because of that, you are building the wall. You would be their king, according to these words.\n",
      "You have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.”\n",
      "Then I sent to him, saying, “There are no such things done as you say, but you imagine them out of your own heart.”\n",
      "For they all would have made us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it not be done.” But now, strengthen my hands.\n",
      "I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home; and he said, “Let us meet together in God’s house, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to kill you; yes, in the night will they come to kill you.”\n",
      "I said, “Should such a man as I flee? Who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.”\n",
      "I discerned, and behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.\n",
      "He hired so that I would be afraid, do so, and sin, and that they might have material for an evil report, that they might reproach me.\n",
      "“Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.”\n",
      "So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.\n",
      "When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations that were around us were afraid, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God.\n",
      "Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them.\n",
      "For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife.\n",
      "Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.\n",
      "Now when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,\n",
      "I put my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, in charge of Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.\n",
      "I said to them, “Don’t let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut the doors, and you bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, with everyone near his house.”\n",
      "Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.\n",
      "My God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found written therein:\n",
      "These are the children of the province, who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, everyone to his city;\n",

      "They read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.\n",
      "Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, “This day is holy to Yahweh your God. Don’t mourn, nor weep.” For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.\n",

      "So the people went out, and brought them, and made themselves booths, everyone on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of God’s house, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.\n",
      "All the assembly of those who had come again out of the captivity made booths, and lived in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so. There was very great gladness.\n",
      "Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. They kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.\n",

      "and found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his offspring, and have performed your words; for you are righteous.\n",
      "“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,\n",
      "and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and made a name for yourself, as it is this day.\n",
      "You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the middle of the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.\n",
      "Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.\n",
      "“You came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,\n",
      "and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant,\n",
      "and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought water out of the rock for them for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.\n",
      "“But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, didn’t listen to your commandments,\n",
      "and refused to obey, neither were they mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn’t forsake them.\n",
      "Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt, ’ and had committed awful blasphemies;\n",
      "yet you in your manifold mercies didn’t forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud didn’t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.\n",
      "You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn’t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.\n",
      "“Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their clothes didn’t grow old, and their feet didn’t swell.\n",
      "Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted according to their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.\n",
      "You also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.\n",
      "“So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they pleased.\n",
      "They took fortified cities, and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.\n",
      "“Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies.\n",
      "Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. In the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.\n",
      "But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies,\n",
      "and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and didn’t listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, (which if a man does, he shall live in them), turned their backs, stiffened their neck, and would not hear.\n",
      "Yet many years you put up with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet would they not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.\n",
      "“Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.\n",
      "Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, don’t let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.\n",
      "However you are just in all that has come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;\n",
      "neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them.\n",
      "For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land which you gave before them, neither did they turn from their wicked works.\n",
      "“Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good, behold, we are servants in it.\n",
      "It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our livestock, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.\n",

      "and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.\n",
      "So stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in God’s house, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;\n",
      "and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;\n",
      "and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.\n",
      "They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.\n",
      "On that day were men appointed over the rooms for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who waited.\n",
      "They performed the duty of their God, and the duty of the purification, and so did the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.\n",
      "For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.\n",
      "All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.\n",
      "On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever,\n",
      "because they didn’t meet the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: however our God turned the curse into a blessing.\n",
      "It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.\n",
      "Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,\n",
      "had prepared for him a great room, where before they laid the meal offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the wave offerings for the priests.\n",
      "But in all this, I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,\n",
      "and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a room in the courts of God’s house.\n",
      "It grieved me severely: therefore I threw all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the room.\n",
      "Then I commanded, and they cleansed the rooms: and there brought I again the vessels of God’s house, with the meal offerings and the frankincense.\n",
      "I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled everyone to his field.\n",
      "Then I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is God’s house forsaken?” I gathered them together, and set them in their place.\n",
      "Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.\n",
      "I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers.\n",
      "Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don’t wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its observances.\n",
      "In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day in which they sold food.\n",
      "There lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all kinds of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.\n",
      "Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day?\n",
      "Didn’t your fathers do thus, and didn’t our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”\n",
      "It came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I set some of my servants over the gates, that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day.\n",
      "So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares camped outside of Jerusalem once or twice.\n",
      "Then I testified against them, and said to them, “Why do you stay around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they didn’t come on the Sabbath.\n",
      "I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness.\n",
      "In those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:\n",
      "and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.\n",
      "I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.\n",
      "Didn’t Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin.\n",
      "Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?”\n",
      "One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.\n",
      "Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.\n",
      "Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners, and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;\n",
      "and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.\n",
      "Now in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),\n",
      "in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,\n",
      "in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him.\n",
      "He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred eighty days.\n",
      "When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.\n",
      "There were hangings of white, green, and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble.\n",
      "They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.\n",
      "In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.\n",
      "Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.\n",
      "On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,\n",
      "to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful.\n",
      "But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the eunuchs. Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him.\n",
      "Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for it was the king’s custom to consult those who knew law and judgment;\n",
      "and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and sat first in the kingdom),\n",
      "“What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?”\n",
      "Memucan answered before the king and the princes, “Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus.\n",
      "For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn’t come.’\n",
      "Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s deed will tell all the king’s princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath.\n",
      "“If it please the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.\n",
      "When the king’s decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honor, both great and small.”\n",
      "This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan:\n",
      "for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people.\n",
      "After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.\n",
      "Then the king’s servants who served him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.\n",
      "Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women’s house, to the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them;\n",
      "and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The thing pleased the king, and he did so.\n",
      "There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,\n",
      "who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.\n",
      "He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.\n",
      "So, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.\n",
      "The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king’s house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women’s house.\n",
      "Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known.\n",
      "Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women’s house, to find out how Esther was doing, and what would become of her.\n",
      "Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women).\n",
      "The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women’s house to the king’s house.\n",
      "In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women’s house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.\n",
      "Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.\n",
      "So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.\n",
      "The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.\n",
      "Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king’s bounty.\n",
      "When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.\n",
      "Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.\n",
      "In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.\n",
      "This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name.\n",
      "When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king’s presence.\n",
      "After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.\n",
      "All the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn’t bow down or pay him homage.\n",
      "Then the king’s servants, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s commandment?”\n",
      "Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn’t listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.\n",
      "When Haman saw that Mordecai didn’t bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath.\n",
      "But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai’s people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai’s people.\n",
      "In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.\n",
      "Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different than other people’s. They don’t keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not for the king’s profit to allow them to remain.\n",
      "If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.”\n",
      "The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.\n",
      "The king said to Haman, “The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.”\n",
      "Then the king’s scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king’s satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king’s ring.\n",
      "Letters were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.\n",
      "A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.\n",
      "The couriers went out in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.\n",
      "Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, and wailed loudly and a bitterly.\n",
      "He came even before the king’s gate, for no one is allowed inside the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.\n",
      "In every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.\n",
      "Esther’s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn’t receive it.\n",
      "Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was.\n",
      "So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king’s gate.\n",
      "Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.\n",
      "He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.\n",
      "Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.\n",
      "Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:\n",
      "“All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.”\n",
      "They told to Mordecai Esther’s words.\n",
      "Then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther, “Don’t think to yourself that you will escape in the king’s house any more than all the Jews.\n",
      "For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you haven’t come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”\n",
      "Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,\n",
      "“Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.”\n",
      "So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.\n",
      "Now on the third day, Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, next to the king’s house. The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house.\n",
      "When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter.\n",
      "Then the king asked her, “What would you like, queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.”\n",
      "Esther said, “If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”\n",
      "Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.\n",
      "The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”\n",
      "Then Esther answered and said, “My petition and my request is this.\n",
      "If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.”\n",
      "Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he didn’t stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.\n",
      "Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife.\n",
      "Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.\n",
      "Haman also said, “Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king.\n",
      "Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”\n",
      "Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it. Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet.” This pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.\n",
      "On that night, the king couldn’t sleep. He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king.\n",
      "It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.\n",
      "The king said, “What honor and dignity has been given to Mordecai for this?” Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”\n",
      "The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king’s house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.\n",
      "The king’s servants said to him, “Behold, Haman stands in the court.” The king said, “Let him come in.”\n",
      "So Haman came in. The king said to him, “What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?” Now Haman said in his heart, “Who would the king delight to honor more than myself?”\n",
      "Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor,\n",
      "let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a crown royal is set.\n",
      "Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!’”\n",
      "Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.”\n",
      "Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!”\n",
      "Mordecai came back to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered.\n",
      "Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him.”\n",
      "While they were yet talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.\n",
      "So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.\n",
      "The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, “What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”\n",
      "Then Esther the queen answered, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.\n",
      "For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for male and female slaves, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s loss.”\n",
      "Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, “Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?”\n",
      "Esther said, “An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!” Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.\n",
      "The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.\n",
      "Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house?” As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.\n",
      "Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said, “Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman’s house.” The king said, “Hang him on it!”\n",
      "So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.\n",
      "On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews’ enemy, to Esther the queen. Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.\n",
      "The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.\n",
      "Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.\n",
      "Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.\n",
      "She said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.\n",
      "For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?”\n",
      "Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews.\n",
      "Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may not be reversed by any man.”\n",
      "Then the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language.\n",
      "He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback, riding on royal horses that were bred from swift steeds.\n",
      "In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their life, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to plunder their possessions,\n",
      "on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.\n",
      "A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.\n",
      "So the couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.\n",
      "Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad.\n",
      "The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor.\n",
      "In every province, and in every city, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast, and a good day. Many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen on them.\n",
      "Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it was turned out the opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated them),\n",
      "the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them. No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.\n",
      "All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king’s business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.\n",
      "For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.\n",
      "The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them.\n",
      "In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.\n",
      "They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,\n",
      "Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,\n",
      "Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,\n",
      "the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew’s enemy, but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.\n",
      "On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.\n",
      "The king said to Esther the queen, “The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your further request? It shall be done.”\n",
      "Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”\n",
      "The king commanded this to be done. A decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.\n",
      "The Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Shushan; but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.\n",
      "The other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.\n",
      "This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.\n",
      "But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.\n",
      "Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents of food to one another.\n",
      "Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,\n",
      "to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly,\n",
      "as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy.\n",
      "The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them;\n",
      "because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast “Pur”, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;\n",
      "but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.\n",
      "Therefore they called these days “Purim”, from the word “Pur.” Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,\n",
      "the Jews established, and imposed on themselves, and on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to its appointed time, every year;\n",
      "and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor their memory perish from their offspring,\n",
      "Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.\n",
      "He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,\n",
      "to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.\n",
      "The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.\n",
      "King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands of the sea.\n",
      "All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?\n",
      "For Mordecai the Jew was next to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brothers, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his descendants.\n",
      "There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.\n",
      "There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.\n",
      "His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.\n",
      "His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.\n",
      "It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.\n",
      "Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan also came among them.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.”\n",
      "Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?\n",
      "Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.\n",
      "But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.” So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh.\n",
      "It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,\n",
      "that there came a messenger to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,\n",
      "and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”\n",
      "While he was still speaking, there also came another, and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”\n",
      "While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”\n",
      "While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,\n",
      "and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”\n",
      "Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped.\n",
      "He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.”\n",
      "In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.\n",
      "Again, on the day when the God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.”\n",
      "Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.\n",
      "But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”\n",
      "So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.\n",
      "He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.\n",
      "Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”\n",
      "But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips.\n",
      "Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.\n",
      "When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.\n",
      "So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.\n",
      "After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.\n",
      "Job answered:\n",
      "“Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’\n",
      "Let that day be darkness. Don’t let God from above seek for it, neither let the light shine on it.\n",
      "Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes black the day terrify it.\n",
      "As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.\n",
      "Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein.\n",
      "Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.\n",
      "Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,\n",
      "because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.\n",
      "“Why didn’t I die from the womb? Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?\n",
      "Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should nurse?\n",
      "For now should I have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,\n",
      "with kings and counselors of the earth, who built up waste places for themselves;\n",
      "or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver:\n",
      "or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, as infants who never saw light.\n",
      "There the wicked cease from troubling. There the weary are at rest.\n",
      "There the prisoners are at ease together. They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.\n",
      "The small and the great are there. The servant is free from his master.\n",
      "“Why is light given to him who is in misery, life to the bitter in soul,\n",
      "Who long for death, but it doesn’t come; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,\n",
      "who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?\n",
      "Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?\n",
      "For my sighing comes before I eat. My groanings are poured out like water.\n",
      "For the thing which I fear comes on me, That which I am afraid of comes to me.\n",
      "I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; but trouble comes.”\n",
      "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,\n",
      "“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?\n",
      "Behold, you have instructed many, you have strengthened the weak hands.\n",
      "Your words have supported him who was falling, You have made firm the feeble knees.\n",
      "But now it has come to you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled.\n",
      "Isn’t your piety your confidence? Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?\n",
      "“Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?\n",
      "According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same.\n",
      "By the breath of God they perish. By the blast of his anger are they consumed.\n",
      "The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions, are broken.\n",
      "The old lion perishes for lack of prey. The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.\n",
      "“Now a thing was secretly brought to me. My ear received a whisper of it.\n",
      "In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,\n",
      "fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.\n",
      "Then a spirit passed before my face. The hair of my flesh stood up.\n",
      "It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes. Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,\n",
      "‘Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?\n",
      "Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. He charges his angels with error.\n",
      "How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!\n",
      "Between morning and evening they are destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it.\n",
      "Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.’\n",
      "“Call now; is there any who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?\n",
      "For resentment kills the foolish man, and jealousy kills the simple.\n",
      "I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation.\n",
      "His children are far from safety. They are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them,\n",
      "whose harvest the hungry eats up, and take it even out of the thorns. The snare gapes for their substance.\n",
      "For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;\n",
      "but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.\n",
      "“But as for me, I would seek God. I would commit my cause to God,\n",
      "who does great things that can’t be fathomed, marvelous things without number;\n",
      "who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields;\n",
      "so that he sets up on high those who are low, those who mourn are exalted to safety.\n",
      "He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.\n",
      "He takes the wise in their own craftiness; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.\n",
      "They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noonday as in the night.\n",
      "But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty.\n",
      "So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.\n",
      "“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.\n",
      "For he wounds, and binds up. He injures, and his hands make whole.\n",
      "He will deliver you in six troubles; yes, in seven no evil shall touch you.\n",
      "In famine he will redeem you from death; in war, from the power of the sword.\n",
      "You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.\n",
      "At destruction and famine you shall laugh, neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth.\n",
      "For you shall be allied with the stones of the field. The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.\n",
      "You shall know that your tent is in peace. You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing.\n",
      "You shall know also that your offspring shall be great, Your offspring as the grass of the earth.\n",
      "You shall come to your grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season.\n",
      "Look this, we have searched it, so it is. Hear it, and know it for your good.”\n",
      "Then Job answered,\n",
      "“Oh that my anguish were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!\n",
      "For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas, therefore have my words been rash.\n",
      "For the arrows of the Almighty are within me. My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.\n",
      "Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?\n",
      "Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?\n",
      "My soul refuses to touch them. They are as loathsome food to me.\n",
      "“Oh that I might have my request, that God would grant the thing that I long for,\n",
      "even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!\n",
      "Be it still my consolation, yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.\n",
      "What is my strength, that I should wait? What is my end, that I should be patient?\n",
      "Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?\n",
      "Isn’t it that I have no help in me, That wisdom is driven quite from me?\n",
      "“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.\n",
      "My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away;\n",
      "Which are black by reason of the ice, in which the snow hides itself.\n",
      "In the dry season, they vanish. When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.\n",
      "The caravans that travel beside them turn aside. They go up into the waste, and perish.\n",
      "The caravans of Tema looked. The companies of Sheba waited for them.\n",
      "They were distressed because they were confident. They came there, and were confounded.\n",
      "For now you are nothing. You see a terror, and are afraid.\n",
      "Did I say, ‘Give to me?’ or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’\n",
      "or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?’ or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?’\n",
      "“Teach me, and I will hold my peace. Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.\n",
      "How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what does it reprove?\n",
      "Do you intend to reprove words, since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?\n",
      "Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend.\n",
      "Now therefore be pleased to look at me, for surely I shall not lie to your face.\n",
      "Please return. Let there be no injustice. Yes, return again. My cause is righteous.\n",
      "Is there injustice on my tongue? Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?\n",
      "“Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth? Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?\n",
      "As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages,\n",
      "so am I made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights are appointed to me.\n",
      "When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I arise, and the night be gone?’ I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.\n",
      "My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.\n",

      "“Have pity on me, have pity on me, you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.\n",
      "Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?\n",
      "“Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!\n",
      "That with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever!\n",
      "But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives. In the end, he will stand upon the earth.\n",
      "After my skin is destroyed, then in my flesh shall I see God,\n",
      "Whom I, even I, shall see on my side. My eyes shall see, and not as a stranger. “My heart is consumed within me.\n",
      "If you say, ‘How we will persecute him!’ because the root of the matter is found in me,\n",
      "be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishments of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment.”\n",
      "Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,\n",
      "“Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason of my haste that is in me.\n",
      "I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame. The spirit of my understanding answers me.\n",

      "that the triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the godless but for a moment?\n",
      "Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds,\n",
      "yet he shall perish forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him shall say, ‘Where is he?’\n",
      "He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found. Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night.\n",
      "The eye which saw him shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more see him.\n",
      "His children shall seek the favor of the poor. His hands shall give back his wealth.\n",
      "His bones are full of his youth, but youth shall lie down with him in the dust.\n",
      "“Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue,\n",
      "though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth;\n",
      "yet his food in his bowels is turned. It is cobra venom within him.\n",
      "He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly.\n",
      "He shall suck cobra venom. The viper’s tongue shall kill him.\n",
      "He shall not look at the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter.\n",
      "That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow it down. According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice.\n",
      "For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.\n",
      "“Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save anything of that in which he delights.\n",
      "There was nothing left that he didn’t devour, therefore his prosperity shall not endure.\n",
      "In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him. The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him.\n",
      "When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him. It will rain on him while he is eating.\n",
      "He shall flee from the iron weapon. The bronze arrow shall strike him through.\n",
      "He draws it out, and it comes out of his body. Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver. Terrors are on him.\n",
      "All darkness is laid up for his treasures. An unfanned fire shall devour him. It shall consume that which is left in his tent.\n",
      "The heavens shall reveal his iniquity. The earth shall rise up against him.\n",
      "The increase of his house shall depart. They shall rush away in the day of his wrath.\n",
      "This is the portion of a wicked man from God, the heritage appointed to him by God.”\n",
      "Then Job answered,\n",
      "“Listen diligently to my speech. Let this be your consolation.\n",

      "Look at me, and be astonished. Lay your hand on your mouth.\n",
      "When I remember, I am troubled. Horror takes hold of my flesh.\n",
      "“Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?\n",
      "Their child is established with them in their sight, their offspring before their eyes.\n",
      "Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.\n",
      "Their bulls breed without fail. Their cows calve, and don’t miscarry.\n",
      "They send out their little ones like a flock. Their children dance.\n",
      "They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.\n",
      "They spend their days in prosperity. In an instant they go down to Sheol.\n",
      "They tell God, ‘Depart from us, for we don’t want to know about your ways.\n",
      "What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What profit should we have, if we pray to him?’\n",
      "Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand. The counsel of the wicked is far from me.\n",
      "“How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out, that their calamity comes on them, that God distributes sorrows in his anger?\n",
      "How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind, as chaff that the storm carries away?\n",
      "You say, ‘God lays up his iniquity for his children.’ Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it.\n",
      "Let his own eyes see his destruction. Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.\n",
      "For what does he care for his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off?\n",
      "“Shall any teach God knowledge, since he judges those who are high?\n",
      "One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.\n",
      "His pails are full of milk. The marrow of his bones is moistened.\n",
      "Another dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good.\n",
      "They lie down alike in the dust. The worm covers them.\n",
      "“Behold, I know your thoughts, the devices with which you would wrong me.\n",
      "For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?’\n",

      "The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him. All men shall draw after him, as there were innumerable before him.\n",
      "So how can you comfort me with nonsense, because in your answers there remains only falsehood?”\n",
      "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,\n",
      "“Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.\n",
      "Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous? Or does it benefit him, that you make your ways perfect?\n",
      "Is it for your piety that he reproves you, that he enters with you into judgment?\n",
      "Isn’t your wickedness great? Neither is there any end to your iniquities.\n",
      "For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.\n",
      "You haven’t given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.\n",
      "But as for the mighty man, he had the earth. The honorable man, he lived in it.\n",
      "You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.\n",
      "Therefore snares are around you. Sudden fear troubles you,\n",

      "Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn’t see. He walks on the vault of the sky.’\n",
      "Will you keep the old way, which wicked men have trodden,\n",
      "who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream,\n",
      "who said to God, ‘Depart from us; ’ and, ‘What can the Almighty do for us?’\n",

      "If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up, if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.\n",
      "Lay your treasure in the dust, the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.\n",
      "The Almighty will be your treasure, and precious silver to you.\n",
      "For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and shall lift up your face to God.\n",
      "You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear you. You shall pay your vows.\n",
      "You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to you. Light shall shine on your ways.\n",
      "When they cast down, you shall say, ‘be lifted up.’ He will save the humble person.\n",
      "He will even deliver him who is not innocent. Yes, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”\n",
      "Then Job answered,\n",
      "“Even today my complaint is rebellious. His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.\n",

      "“If I go east, he is not there; if west, I can’t find him;\n",
      "He works to the north, but I can’t see him. He turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of him.\n",
      "But he knows the way that I take. When he has tried me, I shall come out like gold.\n",
      "My foot has held fast to his steps. I have kept his way, and not turned aside.\n",
      "I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips. I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.\n",
      "But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? What his soul desires, even that he does.\n",
      "For he performs that which is appointed for me. Many such things are with him.\n",
      "Therefore I am terrified at his presence. When I consider, I am afraid of him.\n",
      "For God has made my heart faint. The Almighty has terrified me.\n",
      "Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.\n",
      "“Why aren’t times laid up by the Almighty? Why don’t those who know him see his days?\n",
      "There are people who remove the landmarks. They violently take away flocks, and feed them.\n",
      "They drive away the donkey of the fatherless, and they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.\n",
      "They turn the needy out of the way. The poor of the earth all hide themselves.\n",
      "Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert, they go out to their work, seeking diligently for food. The wilderness yields them bread for their children.\n",
      "They cut their food in the field. They glean the vineyard of the wicked.\n",
      "They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.\n",
      "They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.\n",
      "There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor,\n",
      "So that they go around naked without clothing. Being hungry, they carry the sheaves.\n",
      "They make oil within the walls of these men. They tread wine presses, and suffer thirst.\n",
      "From out of the populous city, men groan. The soul of the wounded cries out, yet God doesn’t regard the folly.\n",
      "“These are of those who rebel against the light. They don’t know its ways, nor stay in its paths.\n",
      "The murderer rises with the light. He kills the poor and needy. In the night he is like a thief.\n",
      "The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, ‘No eye shall see me.’ He disguises his face.\n",
      "In the dark they dig through houses. They shut themselves up in the daytime. They don’t know the light.\n",
      "For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness, for they know the terrors of the thick darkness.\n",
      "“They are foam on the surface of the waters. Their portion is cursed in the earth. They don’t turn into the way of the vineyards.\n",

      "The womb shall forget him. The worm shall feed sweetly on him. He shall be no more remembered. Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.\n",
      "He devours the barren who don’t bear. He shows no kindness to the widow.\n",
      "Yet God preserves the mighty by his power. He rises up who has no assurance of life.\n",
      "God gives them security, and they rest in it. His eyes are on their ways.\n",
      "They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone. Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.\n",
      "If it isn’t so now, who will prove me a liar, and make my speech worth nothing?”\n",
      "Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,\n",

      "He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not burst under them.\n",
      "He encloses the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud on it.\n",
      "He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters, and to the confines of light and darkness.\n",
      "The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.\n",
      "He stirs up the sea with his power, and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab.\n",
      "By his Spirit the heavens are garnished. His hand has pierced the swift serpent.\n",
      "Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways. How small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?”\n",
      "Job again took up his parable, and said,\n",
      "“As God lives, who has taken away my right, the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter.\n",
      "(For the length of my life is still in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);\n",

      "Far be it from me that I should justify you. Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.\n",
      "I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go. My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.\n",
      "“Let my enemy be as the wicked. Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.\n",
      "For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?\n",
      "Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?\n",
      "Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call on God at all times?\n",
      "I will teach you about the hand of God. That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.\n",
      "Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?\n",
      "“This is the portion of a wicked man with God, the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.\n",
      "If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword. His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.\n",
      "Those who remain of him shall be buried in death. His widows shall make no lamentation.\n",
      "Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as the clay;\n",
      "he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.\n",
      "He builds his house as the moth, as a booth which the watchman makes.\n",
      "He lies down rich, but he shall not do so again. He opens his eyes, and he is not.\n",
      "Terrors overtake him like waters. A storm steals him away in the night.\n",
      "The east wind carries him away, and he departs. It sweeps him out of his place.\n",
      "For it hurls at him, and does not spare, as he flees away from his hand.\n",
      "Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.\n",

      "The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.\n",
      "For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it commended me:\n",
      "Because I delivered the poor who cried, and the fatherless also, who had no one to help him,\n",
      "the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.\n",
      "I put on righteousness, and it clothed me. My justice was as a robe and a diadem.\n",
      "I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame.\n",

      "When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.\n",
      "Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, “I am young, and you are very old; Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion.\n",

      "Moreover Yahweh answered Job,\n",
      "“Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it.”\n",
      "Then Job answered Yahweh,\n",
      "“Behold, I am of small account. What shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.\n",
      "I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”\n",
      "Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,\n",
      "“Now brace yourself like a man. I will question you, and you will answer me.\n",
      "Will you even annul my judgment? Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?\n",
      "Or do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like him?\n",
      "“Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity. Array yourself with honor and majesty.\n",
      "Pour out the fury of your anger. Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.\n",
      "Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him. Crush the wicked in their place.\n",
      "Hide them in the dust together. Bind their faces in the hidden place.\n",
      "Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you.\n",
      "“See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you. He eats grass as an ox.\n",
      "Look now, his strength is in his thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly.\n",
      "He moves his tail like a cedar. The sinews of his thighs are knit together.\n",
      "His bones are like tubes of brass. His limbs are like bars of iron.\n",
      "He is the chief of the ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword.\n",
      "Surely the mountains produce food for him, where all the animals of the field play.\n",
      "He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.\n",
      "The lotuses cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook surround him.\n",
      "Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble. He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.\n",
      "Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?\n",
      "“Can you draw out Leviathan with a fish hook, or press down his tongue with a cord?\n",
      "Can you put a rope into his nose, or pierce his jaw through with a hook?\n",
      "Will he make many petitions to you, or will he speak soft words to you?\n",
      "Will he make a covenant with you, that you should take him for a servant forever?\n",
      "Will you play with him as with a bird? Or will you bind him for your girls?\n",
      "Will traders barter for him? Will they part him among the merchants?\n",
      "Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears?\n",
      "Lay your hand on him. Remember the battle, and do so no more.\n",
      "Behold, the hope of him is in vain. Won’t one be cast down even at the sight of him?\n",
      "None is so fierce that he dare stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me?\n",
      "Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Everything under the heavens is mine.\n",
      "“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.\n",
      "Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws?\n",
      "Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror.\n",
      "Strong scales are his pride, shut up together with a close seal.\n",
      "One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.\n",
      "They are joined to one another. They stick together, so that they can’t be pulled apart.\n",
      "His sneezing flashes out light. His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.\n",
      "Out of his mouth go burning torches. Sparks of fire leap out.\n",
      "Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.\n",
      "His breath kindles coals. A flame goes out of his mouth.\n",
      "There is strength in his neck. Terror dances before him.\n",
      "The flakes of his flesh are joined together. They are firm on him. They can’t be moved.\n",
      "His heart is as firm as a stone, yes, firm as the lower millstone.\n",
      "When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid. They retreat before his thrashing.\n",
      "If one attacks him with the sword, it can’t prevail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.\n",
      "He counts iron as straw; and brass as rotten wood.\n",
      "The arrow can’t make him flee. Sling stones are like chaff to him.\n",
      "Clubs are counted as stubble. He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.\n",
      "His undersides are like sharp potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.\n",
      "He makes the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.\n",
      "He makes a path shine after him. One would think the deep had white hair.\n",
      "On earth there is not his equal, that is made without fear.\n",
      "He sees everything that is high. He is king over all the sons of pride.”\n",
      "Then Job answered Yahweh,\n",
      "“I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.\n",
      "You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’ therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.\n",
      "You said, ‘Listen, now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you will answer me.’\n",
      "I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you.\n",
      "Therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.”\n",
      "It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.\n",
      "Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”\n",
      "So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job.\n",
      "Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.\n",
      "Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money, and everyone a ring of gold.\n",
      "So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.\n",
      "He had also seven sons and three daughters.\n",
      "He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch.\n",
      "In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.\n",
      "After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations.\n",
      "So Job died, being old and full of days.\n",
      "Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand on the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers;\n",
      "but his delight is in Yahweh’s law. On his law he meditates day and night.\n",
      "He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that produces its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.\n",
      "The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.\n",
      "Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.\n",
      "For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.\n",
      "Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?\n",
      "The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against Yahweh, and against his Anointed, saying,\n",
      "“Let’s break their bonds apart, and cast their cords from us.”\n",
      "He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Lord will have them in derision.\n",
      "Then he will speak to them in his anger, and terrify them in his wrath:\n",
      "“Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”\n",
      "I will tell of the decree. Yahweh said to me, “You are my son. Today I have become your father.\n",
      "Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.\n",
      "You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”\n",
      "Now therefore be wise, you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth.\n",
      "Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling.\n",
      "Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish on the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.\n",
      "Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased! Many are those who rise up against me.\n",
      "Many there are who say of my soul, “There is no help for him in God.” Selah.\n",
      "But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.\n",
      "I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.\n",
      "I laid myself down and slept. I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.\n",
      "I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side.\n",
      "Arise, Yahweh! Save me, my God! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.\n",
      "Salvation belongs to Yahweh. Your blessing be on your people. Selah.\n",
      "Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.\n",
      "You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.\n",
      "But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly: Yahweh will hear when I call to him.\n",
      "Stand in awe, and don’t sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.\n",
      "Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put your trust in Yahweh.\n",
      "Many say, “Who will show us any good?” Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.\n",
      "You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.\n",
      "In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, for you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety.\n",
      "Give ear to my words, Yahweh. Consider my meditation.\n",
      "Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to you do I pray.\n",
      "Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.\n",
      "For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil can’t live with you.\n",
      "The arrogant shall not stand in your sight. You hate all workers of iniquity.\n",
      "You will destroy those who speak lies. Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.\n",
      "But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house. I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.\n",
      "Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face.\n",
      "For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their heart is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter with their tongue.\n",
      "Hold them guilty, God. Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against you.\n",
      "But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice, Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.\n",
      "For you will bless the righteous. Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield.\n",
      "Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me in your wrath.\n",
      "Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.\n",
      "My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Yahweh—how long?\n",
      "Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, and save me for your loving kindness’ sake.\n",
      "For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?\n",
      "I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears.\n",
      "My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries.\n",
      "Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.\n",
      "Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh accepts my prayer.\n",
      "May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.\n",
      "Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,\n",
      "lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver.\n",
      "Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands,\n",
      "if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),\n",
      "let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.\n",
      "Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.\n",
      "Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high.\n",
      "Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me.\n",
      "Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.\n",
      "My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.\n",
      "God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who has indignation every day.\n",
      "If a man doesn’t relent, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent and strung his bow.\n",
      "He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows.\n",
      "Behold, he travails with iniquity. Yes, he has conceived mischief, and brought out falsehood.\n",
      "He has dug a hole, and has fallen into the pit which he made.\n",
      "The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.\n",
      "I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.\n",
      "Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth, who has set your glory above the heavens!\n",
      "From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.\n",
      "When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;\n",
      "what is man, that you think of him? What is the son of man, that you care for him?\n",
      "For you have made him a little lower than God, and crowned him with glory and honor.\n",
      "You make him ruler over the works of your hands. You have put all things under his feet:\n",
      "All sheep and cattle, yes, and the animals of the field,\n",
      "The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.\n",
      "Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!\n",
      "I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart. I will tell of all your marvelous works.\n",
      "I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.\n",
      "When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish in your presence.\n",
      "For you have maintained my just cause. You sit on the throne judging righteously.\n",
      "You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked. You have blotted out their name forever and ever.\n",
      "The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.\n",
      "But Yahweh reigns forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment.\n",
      "He will judge the world in righteousness. He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.\n",
      "Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed; a high tower in times of trouble.\n",
      "Those who know your name will put their trust in you, for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.\n",
      "Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion, and declare among the people what he has done.\n",
      "For he who avenges blood remembers them. He doesn’t forget the cry of the afflicted.\n",
      "Have mercy on me, Yahweh. See my affliction by those who hate me, and lift me up from the gates of death;\n",
      "that I may show all of your praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion, I will rejoice in your salvation.\n",
      "The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.\n",
      "Yahweh has made himself known. He has executed judgment. The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. Meditation. Selah.\n",
      "The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God.\n",
      "For the needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the poor perish forever.\n",
      "Arise, Yahweh! Don’t let man prevail. Let the nations be judged in your sight.\n",
      "Put them in fear, Yahweh. Let the nations know that they are only men. Selah.\n",
      "Why do you stand far off, Yahweh? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?\n",
      "In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. They are caught in the schemes that they devise.\n",
      "For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings. He blesses the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.\n",
      "The wicked, in the pride of his face, has no room in his thoughts for God.\n",
      "His ways are prosperous at all times. He is haughty, and your laws are far from his sight. As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.\n",
      "He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken. For generations I shall have no trouble.”\n",
      "His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.\n",
      "He lies in wait near the villages. From ambushes, he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.\n",
      "He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. He lies in wait to catch the helpless. He catches the helpless, when he draws him in his net.\n",
      "The helpless are crushed. They collapse. They fall under his strength.\n",
      "He says in his heart, “God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it.”\n",
      "Arise, Yahweh! God, lift up your hand! Don’t forget the helpless.\n",
      "Why does the wicked person condemn God, and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account?”\n",
      "But you do see trouble and grief. You consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the fatherless.\n",
      "Break the arm of the wicked. As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.\n",
      "Yahweh is King forever and ever! The nations will perish out of his land.\n",
      "Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,\n",
      "to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.\n",
      "In Yahweh, I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain!”\n",
      "For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.\n",
      "If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?\n",
      "Yahweh is in his holy temple. Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men.\n",
      "Yahweh examines the righteous, but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.\n",
      "On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.\n",
      "For Yahweh is righteous. He loves righteousness. The upright shall see his face.\n",
      "Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases. For the faithful fail from among the children of men.\n",
      "Everyone lies to his neighbor. They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.\n",
      "May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts,\n",
      "who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?”\n",
      "“Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, I will now arise, ” says Yahweh; “I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”\n",
      "Yahweh’s words are flawless words, as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.\n",
      "You will keep them, Yahweh. You will preserve them from this generation forever.\n",
      "The wicked walk on every side, when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.\n",
      "How long, Yahweh? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?\n",
      "How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me?\n",
      "Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;\n",
      "Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him”; Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.\n",
      "But I trust in your loving kindness. My heart rejoices in your salvation.\n",
      "I will sing to Yahweh, because he has been good to me.\n",
      "The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt. They have done abominable deeds. There is no one who does good.\n",
      "Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who understood, who sought after God.\n",
      "They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt. There is no one who does good, no, not one.\n",
      "Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don’t call on Yahweh?\n",
      "There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous.\n",
      "You frustrate the plan of the poor, because Yahweh is his refuge.\n",
      "Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.\n",
      "Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill?\n",
      "He who walks blamelessly does what is right, and speaks truth in his heart;\n",
      "He who doesn’t slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor casts slurs against his fellow man;\n",
      "In whose eyes a vile man is despised, but who honors those who fear Yahweh; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change;\n",
      "he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury, nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be shaken.\n",
      "Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge.\n",
      "My soul, you have said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord. Apart from you I have no good thing.”\n",
      "As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.\n",
      "Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names on my lips.\n",
      "Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup. You made my lot secure.\n",
      "The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a good inheritance.\n",
      "I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel. Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.\n",
      "I have set Yahweh always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.\n",
      "Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety.\n",
      "For you will not leave my soul in Sheol, neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.\n",
      "You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.\n",
      "Hear, Yahweh, my righteous plea; Give ear to my prayer, that doesn’t go out of deceitful lips.\n",
      "Let my sentence come out of your presence. Let your eyes look on equity.\n",
      "You have proved my heart. You have visited me in the night. You have tried me, and found nothing. I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.\n",
      "As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips, I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.\n",
      "My steps have held fast to your paths. My feet have not slipped.\n",
      "I have called on you, for you will answer me, God. Turn your ear to me. Hear my speech.\n",
      "Show your marvelous loving kindness, you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.\n",
      "Keep me as the apple of your eye. Hide me under the shadow of your wings,\n",
      "from the wicked who oppress me, my deadly enemies, who surround me.\n",
      "They close up their callous hearts. With their mouth they speak proudly.\n",
      "They have now surrounded us in our steps. They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.\n",
      "He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.\n",
      "Arise, Yahweh, confront him. Cast him down. Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword;\n",
      "from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life. You fill the belly of your cherished ones. Your sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.\n",
      "As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.\n",
      "I love you, Yahweh, my strength.\n",
      "Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.\n",
      "I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised; and I am saved from my enemies.\n",

      "I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet.\n",
      "For you have armed me with strength to the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.\n",

      "Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your wrath, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.\n",
      "For your arrows have pierced me, your hand presses hard on me.\n",
      "There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation, neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.\n",

      "Lord, all my desire is before you. My groaning is not hidden from you.\n",
      "My heart throbs. My strength fails me. As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.\n",
      "My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague. My kinsmen stand far away.\n",
      "They also who seek after my life lay snares. Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits all day long.\n",
      "But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear. I am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth.\n",
      "Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear, in whose mouth are no reproofs.\n",
      "For in you, Yahweh, do I hope. You will answer, Lord my God.\n",
      "For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me, or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.”\n",
      "For I am ready to fall. My pain is continually before me.\n",
      "For I will declare my iniquity. I will be sorry for my sin.\n",
      "But my enemies are vigorous and many. Those who hate me without reason are numerous.\n",
      "They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me, because I follow what is good.\n",
      "Don’t forsake me, Yahweh. My God, don’t be far from me.\n",
      "Hurry to help me, Lord, my salvation.\n",
      "I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my tongue. I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.”\n",
      "I was mute with silence. I held my peace, even from good. My sorrow was stirred.\n",
      "My heart was hot within me. While I meditated, the fire burned: I spoke with my tongue:\n",
      "“Yahweh, show me my end, what is the measure of my days. Let me know how frail I am.\n",
      "Behold, you have made my days hand breadths. My lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely every man stands as a breath.” Selah.\n",
      "“Surely every man walks like a shadow. Surely they busy themselves in vain. He heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather.\n",
      "Now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in you.\n",
      "Deliver me from all my transgressions. Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish.\n",
      "I was mute. I didn’t open my mouth, because you did it.\n",
      "Remove your scourge away from me. I am overcome by the blow of your hand.\n",
      "When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity, You consume his wealth like a moth. Surely every man is but a breath.” Selah.\n",
      "“Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry. Don’t be silent at my tears. For I am a stranger with you, a foreigner, as all my fathers were.\n",
      "Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go away, and exist no more.”\n",
      "I waited patiently for Yahweh. He turned to me, and heard my cry.\n",
      "He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay. He set my feet on a rock, and gave me a firm place to stand.\n",
      "He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.\n",
      "Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust, and doesn’t respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.\n",
      "Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done, and your thoughts which are toward us. They can’t be declared back to you. If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.\n",
      "Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire. You have opened my ears. You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.\n",
      "Then I said, “Behold, I have come. It is written about me in the book in the scroll.\n",
      "I delight to do your will, my God. Yes, your law is within my heart.”\n",
      "I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly. Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you know.\n",
      "I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart. I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation. I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.\n",
      "Don’t withhold your tender mercies from me, Yahweh. Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.\n",
      "For innumerable evils have surrounded me. My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up. They are more than the hairs of my head. My heart has failed me.\n",
      "Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me. Hurry to help me, Yahweh.\n",
      "Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it. Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.\n",
      "Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, “Aha! Aha!”\n",
      "Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let such as love your salvation say continually, “Let Yahweh be exalted!”\n",
      "But I am poor and needy. May the Lord think about me. You are my help and my deliverer. Don’t delay, my God.\n",
      "Blessed is he who considers the poor. Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil.\n",
      "Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive. He shall be blessed on the earth, and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies.\n",
      "Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed, and restore him from his bed of illness.\n",
      "I said, “Yahweh, have mercy on me! Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”\n",
      "My enemies speak evil against me: “When will he die, and his name perish?”\n",
      "If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood. His heart gathers iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he tells it.\n",
      "All who hate me whisper together against me. They imagine the worst for me.\n",
      "“An evil disease”, they say, “has afflicted him. Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.”\n",
      "Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate bread with me, has lifted up his heel against me.\n",
      "But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up, that I may repay them.\n",
      "By this I know that you delight in me, because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me.\n",
      "As for me, you uphold me in my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.\n",
      "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting! Amen and amen.\n",
      "As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants after you, God.\n",
      "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?\n",
      "My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”\n",
      "These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day.\n",
      "Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence.\n",
      "My God, my soul is in despair within me. Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar.\n",
      "Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. All your waves and your billows have swept over me.\n",
      "Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime. In the night his song shall be with me: a prayer to the God of my life.\n",
      "I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”\n",
      "As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”\n",
      "Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him, the saving help of my countenance, and my God.\n",
      "Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.\n",
      "For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?\n",
      "Oh, send out your light and your truth. Let them lead me. Let them bring me to your holy hill, To your tents.\n",
      "Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy. I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.\n",
      "Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him: my Savior, my helper, and my God.\n",
      "We have heard with our ears, God; our fathers have told us, what work you did in their days, in the days of old.\n",
      "You drove out the nations with your hand, but you planted them. You afflicted the peoples, but you spread them abroad.\n",
      "For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, because you were favorable to them.\n",
      "You are my King, God. Command victories for Jacob!\n",
      "Through you, will we push down our adversaries. Through your name, will we tread them under who rise up against us.\n",
      "For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.\n",
      "But you have saved us from our adversaries, and have shamed those who hate us.\n",
      "In God we have made our boast all day long, we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah.\n",
      "But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, and don’t go out with our armies.\n",
      "You make us turn back from the adversary. Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.\n",
      "You have made us like sheep for food, and have scattered us among the nations.\n",
      "You sell your people for nothing, and have gained nothing from their sale.\n",
      "You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.\n",
      "You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.\n",
      "All day long my dishonor is before me, and shame covers my face,\n",
      "At the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses, because of the enemy and the avenger.\n",
      "All this has come on us, yet have we not forgotten you, Neither have we been false to your covenant.\n",
      "Our heart has not turned back, neither have our steps strayed from your path,\n",
      "Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.\n",
      "If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread out our hands to a strange god;\n",
      "won’t God search this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart.\n",
      "Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long. We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.\n",
      "Wake up! Why do you sleep, Lord? Arise! Don’t reject us forever.\n",
      "Why do you hide your face, and forget our affliction and our oppression?\n",
      "For our soul is bowed down to the dust. Our body clings to the earth.\n",
      "Rise up to help us. Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.\n",
      "My heart overflows with a noble theme. I recite my verses for the king. My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.\n",
      "You are the most excellent of the sons of men. Grace has anointed your lips, therefore God has blessed you forever.\n",

      "Your throne, God, is forever and ever. A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.\n",
      "You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.\n",
      "All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia. Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.\n",
      "Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women. At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.\n",
      "Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear. Forget your own people, and also your father’s house.\n",
      "So the king will desire your beauty, honor him, for he is your lord.\n",

      "The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved. He lifted his voice, and the earth melted.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.\n",
      "Come, see Yahweh’s works, what desolations he has made in the earth.\n",
      "He makes wars cease to the end of the earth. He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear. He burns the chariots in the fire.\n",
      "“Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the earth.”\n",

      "Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his loving kindness from me.\n",
      "May God be merciful to us, bless us, and cause his face to shine on us. Selah.\n",
      "That your way may be known on earth, and your salvation among all nations,\n",
      "let the peoples praise you, God. Let all the peoples praise you.\n",

      "Let God arise! Let his enemies be scattered! Let them who hate him also flee before him.\n",
      "As smoke is driven away, so drive them away. As wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.\n",
      "But let the righteous be glad. Let them rejoice before God. Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.\n",
      "Sing to God! Sing praises to his name! Extol him who rides on the clouds: to Yah, his name! Rejoice before him!\n",
      "A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.\n",
      "God sets the lonely in families. He brings out the prisoners with singing, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.\n",
      "God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness... Selah.\n",
      "The earth trembled. The sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai— at the presence of God, the God of Israel.\n",
      "You, God, sent a plentiful rain. You confirmed your inheritance, when it was weary.\n",
      "Your congregation lived therein. You, God, prepared your goodness for the poor.\n",
      "The Lord announced the word. The ones who proclaim it are a great company.\n",
      "“Kings of armies flee! They flee!” She who waits at home divides the plunder,\n",
      "while you sleep among the camp fires, the wings of a dove sheathed with silver, her feathers with shining gold.\n",
      "When the Almighty scattered kings in her, it snowed on Zalmon.\n",
      "The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains. The mountains of Bashan are rugged.\n",
      "Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains, at the mountain where God chooses to reign? Yes, Yahweh will dwell there forever.\n",
      "The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands. The Lord is among them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary.\n",
      "You have ascended on high. You have led away captives. You have received gifts among men, yes, among the rebellious also, that Yah God might dwell there.\n",
      "Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens, even the God who is our salvation. Selah.\n",
      "God is to us a God of deliverance. To Yahweh, the Lord, belongs escape from death.\n",
      "But God will strike through the head of his enemies, the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness.\n",
      "The Lord said, “I will bring you again from Bashan, I will bring you again from the depths of the sea;\n",
      "That you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies.”\n",

      "I am weary with my crying. My throat is dry. My eyes fail, looking for my God.\n",
      "Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. I have to restore what I didn’t take away.\n",
      "God, you know my foolishness. My sins aren’t hidden from you.\n",
      "Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord Yahweh of Armies. Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.\n",
      "Because for your sake, I have borne reproach. Shame has covered my face.\n",
      "I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother’s children.\n",
      "For the zeal of your house consumes me. The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.\n",
      "When I wept and I fasted, that was to my reproach.\n",
      "When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.\n",
      "Those who sit in the gate talk about me. I am the song of the drunkards.\n",
      "But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time. God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.\n",
      "Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink. Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.\n",
      "Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up. Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me.\n",
      "Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good. According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.\n",
      "Don’t hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me speedily!\n",
      "Draw near to my soul, and redeem it. Ransom me because of my enemies.\n",
      "You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor. My adversaries are all before you.\n",
      "Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; for comforters, but I found none.\n",
      "They also gave me gall for my food. In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.\n",
      "Let their table before them become a snare. May it become a retribution and a trap.\n",
      "Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see. Let their backs be continually bent.\n",
      "Pour out your indignation on them. Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.\n",
      "Let their habitation be desolate. Let no one dwell in their tents.\n",
      "For they persecute him whom you have wounded. They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.\n",
      "Charge them with crime upon crime. Don’t let them come into your righteousness.\n",
      "Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.\n",
      "But I am in pain and distress. Let your salvation, God, protect me.\n",
      "I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.\n",
      "It will please Yahweh better than an ox, or a bull that has horns and hoofs.\n",
      "The humble have seen it, and are glad. You who seek after God, let your heart live.\n",
      "For Yahweh hears the needy, and doesn’t despise his captive people.\n",
      "Let heaven and earth praise him; the seas, and everything that moves therein!\n",
      "For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah. They shall settle there, and own it.\n",
      "The children also of his servants shall inherit it. Those who love his name shall dwell therein.\n",
      "Hurry, God, to deliver me. Come quickly to help me, Yahweh.\n",
      "Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.\n",
      "Let them be turned because of their shame Who say, “Aha! Aha!”\n",
      "Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation continually say, “Let God be exalted!”\n",
      "But I am poor and needy. Come to me quickly, God. You are my help and my deliverer. Yahweh, don’t delay.\n",
      "In you, Yahweh, I take refuge. Never let me be disappointed.\n",
      "Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me. Turn your ear to me, and save me.\n",
      "Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go. Give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.\n",
      "Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.\n",
      "For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh; my confidence from my youth.\n",
      "I have relied on you from the womb. You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb. I will always praise you.\n",
      "I am a marvel to many, but you are my strong refuge.\n",
      "My mouth shall be filled with your praise, with your honor all the day.\n",
      "Don’t reject me in my old age. Don’t forsake me when my strength fails.\n",
      "For my enemies talk about me. Those who watch for my soul conspire together,\n",
      "saying, “God has forsaken him. Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him.”\n",
      "God, don’t be far from me. My God, hurry to help me.\n",
      "Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed. Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.\n",
      "But I will always hope, and will add to all of your praise.\n",
      "My mouth will tell about your righteousness, and of your salvation all day, though I don’t know its full measure.\n",
      "I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh. I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.\n",
      "God, you have taught me from my youth. Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.\n",
      "Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don’t forsake me, until I have declared your strength to the next generation, your might to everyone who is to come.\n",
      "Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens; you have done great things. God, who is like you?\n",
      "You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles, you will let me live. You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.\n",
      "Increase my honor, and comfort me again.\n",
      "I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God. I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.\n",
      "My lips shall shout for joy! My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!\n",
      "My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long, for they are disappointed, and they are confounded, who want to harm me.\n",
      "God, give the king your justice; your righteousness to the royal son.\n",
      "He will judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice.\n",
      "The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people. The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.\n",
      "He will judge the poor of the people. He will save the children of the needy, and will break the oppressor in pieces.\n",
      "They shall fear you while the sun endures; and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.\n",
      "He will come down like rain on the mown grass, as showers that water the earth.\n",
      "In his days, the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.\n",
      "He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, from the River to the ends of the earth.\n",
      "Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him. His enemies shall lick the dust.\n",
      "The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute. The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.\n",
      "Yes, all kings shall fall down before him. All nations shall serve him.\n",
      "For he will deliver the needy when he cries; the poor, who has no helper.\n",
      "He will have pity on the poor and needy. He will save the souls of the needy.\n",
      "He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence. Their blood will be precious in his sight.\n",
      "They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba. Men shall pray for him continually. They shall bless him all day long.\n",
      "Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land. Its fruit sways like Lebanon. Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field.\n",
      "His name endures forever. His name continues as long as the sun. Men shall be blessed by him. All nations will call him blessed.\n",
      "Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.\n",
      "Blessed be his glorious name forever! Let the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and amen.\n",
      "This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.\n",
      "Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.\n",
      "But as for me, my feet were almost gone. My steps had nearly slipped.\n",
      "For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.\n",
      "For there are no struggles in their death, but their strength is firm.\n",
      "They are free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued like other men.\n",
      "Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck. Violence covers them like a garment.\n",
      "Their eyes bulge with fat. Their minds pass the limits of conceit.\n",
      "They scoff and speak with malice. In arrogance, they threaten oppression.\n",
      "They have set their mouth in the heavens. Their tongue walks through the earth.\n",
      "Therefore their people return to them, and they drink up waters of abundance.\n",
      "They say, “How does God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?”\n",
      "Behold, these are the wicked. Being always at ease, they increase in riches.\n",
      "Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocence,\n",
      "For all day long have I been plagued, and punished every morning.\n",
      "If I had said, “I will speak thus”; behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.\n",
      "When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me;\n",
      "Until I entered God’s sanctuary, and considered their latter end.\n",
      "Surely you set them in slippery places. You throw them down to destruction.\n",
      "How they are suddenly destroyed! They are completely swept away with terrors.\n",
      "As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.\n",
      "For my soul was grieved. I was embittered in my heart.\n",
      "I was so senseless and ignorant. I was a brute beast before you.\n",
      "Nevertheless, I am continually with you. You have held my right hand.\n",
      "You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.\n",
      "Whom do I have in heaven? There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you.\n",
      "My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.\n",
      "For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.\n",
      "But it is good for me to come close to God. I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.\n",
      "God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?\n",
      "Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance; Mount Zion, in which you have lived.\n",
      "Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.\n",
      "Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly. They have set up their standards as signs.\n",
      "They behaved like men wielding axes, cutting through a thicket of trees.\n",
      "Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.\n",
      "They have burned your sanctuary to the ground. They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.\n",
      "They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.” They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped.\n",
      "We see no miraculous signs. There is no longer any prophet, neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.\n",
      "How long, God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?\n",
      "Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? Take it out of your pocket and consume them!\n",
      "Yet God is my King of old, working salvation throughout the earth.\n",
      "You divided the sea by your strength. You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.\n",
      "You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces. You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.\n",
      "You opened up spring and stream. You dried up mighty rivers.\n",
      "The day is yours, the night is also yours. You have prepared the light and the sun.\n",
      "You have set all the boundaries of the earth. You have made summer and winter.\n",
      "Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh. Foolish people have blasphemed your name.\n",
      "Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts. Don’t forget the life of your poor forever.\n",
      "Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.\n",
      "Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed. Let the poor and needy praise your name.\n",
      "Arise, God! Plead your own cause. Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.\n",
      "Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.\n",
      "We give thanks to you, God. We give thanks, for your Name is near. Men tell about your wondrous works.\n",
      "When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly.\n",
      "The earth and all its inhabitants quake. I firmly hold its pillars. Selah.\n",
      "I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!” I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.\n",
      "Don’t lift up your horn on high. Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”\n",
      "For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.\n",
      "But God is the judge. He puts down one, and lifts up another.\n",
      "For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out. Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.\n",
      "But I will declare this forever: I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.\n",
      "I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.\n",
      "In Judah, God is known. His name is great in Israel.\n",
      "His tabernacle is also in Salem; His dwelling place in Zion.\n",
      "There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.\n",
      "Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.\n",
      "Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep. None of the men of war can lift their hands.\n",
      "At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.\n",
      "You, even you, are to be feared. Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?\n",
      "You pronounced judgment from heaven. The earth feared, and was silent,\n",
      "when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. Selah.\n",
      "Surely the wrath of man praises you. The survivors of your wrath are restrained.\n",
      "Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them! Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.\n",
      "He will cut off the spirit of princes. He is feared by the kings of the earth.\n",
      "My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for him to listen to me.\n",
      "In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired. My soul refused to be comforted.\n",
      "I remember God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.\n",
      "You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I can’t speak.\n",
      "I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.\n",
      "I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:\n",
      "“Will the Lord reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more?\n",
      "Has his loving kindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations?\n",
      "Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?” Selah.\n",
      "Then I thought, “I will appeal to this: the years of the right hand of the Most High.”\n",
      "I will remember Yah’s deeds; for I will remember your wonders of old.\n",
      "I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings.\n",
      "Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. What god is great like God?\n",
      "You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples.\n",
      "You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.\n",
      "The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.\n",
      "The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.\n",
      "The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.\n",
      "Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.\n",
      "You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.\n",
      "Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.\n",
      "I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,\n",
      "Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.\n",
      "We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.\n",
      "For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;\n",
      "that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,\n",
      "that they might set their hope in God, and not forget God’s deeds, but keep his commandments,\n",
      "and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.\n",
      "The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.\n",
      "They didn’t keep God’s covenant, and refused to walk in his law.\n",
      "They forgot his doings, his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.\n",
      "He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.\n",
      "He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.\n",
      "In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.\n",
      "He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.\n",
      "He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.\n",
      "Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.\n",
      "They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.\n",
      "Yes, they spoke against God. They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?\n",
      "Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?”\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,\n",
      "because they didn’t believe in God, and didn’t trust in his salvation.\n",
      "Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.\n",
      "He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.\n",
      "Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.\n",
      "He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind.\n",
      "He rained also flesh on them as the dust; winged birds as the sand of the seas.\n",
      "He let them fall in the middle of their camp, around their habitations.\n",
      "So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.\n",
      "They didn’t turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,\n",
      "when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of their fattest, and struck down the young men of Israel.\n",
      "For all this they still sinned, and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.\n",
      "Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.\n",
      "When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.\n",
      "They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.\n",
      "But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.\n",
      "For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.\n",
      "But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn’t stir up all his wrath.\n",
      "He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.\n",
      "How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!\n",
      "They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.\n",
      "They didn’t remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;\n",
      "how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,\n",
      "he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.\n",
      "He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.\n",
      "He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.\n",
      "He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.\n",
      "He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.\n",
      "He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.\n",
      "He made a path for his anger. He didn’t spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,\n",
      "and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.\n",
      "But he led out his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.\n",
      "He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.\n",
      "He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.\n",
      "He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.\n",
      "Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn’t keep his testimonies;\n",
      "but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.\n",
      "For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.\n",
      "When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;\n",
      "So that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;\n",
      "and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary’s hand.\n",
      "He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.\n",
      "Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.\n",
      "Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn’t weep.\n",
      "Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.\n",
      "He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.\n",
      "Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,\n",
      "But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.\n",
      "He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.\n",
      "He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;\n",
      "from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.\n",
      "So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.\n",
      "God, the nations have come into your inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.\n",
      "They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.\n",
      "Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them.\n",
      "We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.\n",
      "How long, Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?\n",
      "Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you; on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name;\n",
      "For they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.\n",
      "Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.\n",
      "Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.\n",
      "Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.\n",
      "Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.\n",
      "Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.\n",
      "So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever. We will praise you forever, to all generations.\n",
      "Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit above the cherubim, shine out.\n",
      "Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might! Come to save us!\n",
      "Turn us again, God. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.\n",
      "Yahweh God of Armies, How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?\n",
      "You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.\n",
      "You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.\n",
      "Turn us again, God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.\n",
      "You brought a vine out of Egypt. You drove out the nations, and planted it.\n",
      "You cleared the ground for it. It took deep root, and filled the land.\n",
      "The mountains were covered with its shadow. Its boughs were like God’s cedars.\n",
      "It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.\n",
      "Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?\n",
      "The boar out of the wood ravages it. The wild animals of the field feed on it.\n",
      "Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies. Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,\n",
      "the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you made strong for yourself.\n",
      "It’s burned with fire. It’s cut down. They perish at your rebuke.\n",
      "Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.\n",
      "So we will not turn away from you. Revive us, and we will call on your name.\n",
      "Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.\n",
      "Sing aloud to God, our strength! Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob!\n",
      "Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp.\n",
      "Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.\n",
      "For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.\n",
      "He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn’t know.\n",
      "“I removed his shoulder from the burden. His hands were freed from the basket.\n",
      "You called in trouble, and I delivered you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah.” Selah.\n",
      "“Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel, if you would listen to me!\n",
      "There shall be no strange god in you, neither shall you worship any foreign god.\n",
      "I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.\n",
      "But my people didn’t listen to my voice. Israel desired none of me.\n",
      "So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts, that they might walk in their own counsels.\n",
      "Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!\n",
      "I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries.\n",
      "The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.\n",
      "But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat. I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.”\n",
      "God presides in the great assembly. He judges among the gods.\n",
      "“How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked?” Selah.\n",
      "“Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless. Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.\n",
      "Rescue the weak and needy. Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”\n",
      "They don’t know, neither do they understand. They walk back and forth in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.\n",
      "I said, “You are gods, all of you are sons of the Most High.\n",
      "Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.”\n",
      "Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.\n",
      "God, don’t keep silent. Don’t keep silent, and don’t be still, God.\n",
      "For, behold, your enemies are stirred up. Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.\n",
      "They conspire with cunning against your people. They plot against your cherished ones.\n",
      "“Come, ” they say, “let’s destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.”\n",
      "For they have conspired together with one mind. They form an alliance against you.\n",
      "The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;\n",
      "Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;\n",
      "Assyria also is joined with them. They have helped the children of Lot. Selah.\n",
      "Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;\n",
      "who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth.\n",
      "Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;\n",
      "who said, “Let us take possession of God’s pasture lands.”\n",
      "My God, make them like tumbleweed; like chaff before the wind.\n",
      "As the fire that burns the forest, as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,\n",
      "so pursue them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm.\n",
      "Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek your name, Yahweh.\n",
      "Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever. Yes, let them be confounded and perish;\n",
      "that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, are the Most High over all the earth.\n",
      "How lovely are your dwellings, Yahweh of Armies!\n",
      "My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh. My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.\n",
      "Yes, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young, near your altars, Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God.\n",
      "Blessed are those who dwell in your house. They are always praising you. Selah.\n",
      "Blessed are those whose strength is in you; who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.\n",
      "Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs. Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.\n",
      "They go from strength to strength. Everyone of them appears before God in Zion.\n",
      "Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer. Listen, God of Jacob. Selah.\n",
      "Behold, God our shield, look at the face of your anointed.\n",
      "For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.\n",
      "For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield. Yahweh will give grace and glory. He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies, blessed is the man who trusts in you.\n",
      "Yahweh, you have been favorable to your land. You have restored the fortunes of Jacob.\n",
      "You have forgiven the iniquity of your people. You have covered all their sin. Selah.\n",
      "You have taken away all your wrath. You have turned from the fierceness of your anger.\n",
      "Turn us, God of our salvation, and cause your indignation toward us to cease.\n",
      "Will you be angry with us forever? Will you draw out your anger to all generations?\n",
      "Won’t you revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?\n",
      "Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh. Grant us your salvation.\n",
      "I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, his saints; but let them not turn again to folly.\n",
      "Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.\n",
      "Mercy and truth meet together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.\n",
      "Truth springs out of the earth. Righteousness has looked down from heaven.\n",
      "Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good. Our land will yield its increase.\n",
      "Righteousness goes before him, And prepares the way for his steps.\n",

      "Bring joy to the soul of your servant, for to you, Lord, do I lift up my soul.\n",
      "For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive; abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you.\n",
      "Hear, Yahweh, my prayer. Listen to the voice of my petitions.\n",
      "In the day of my trouble I will call on you, for you will answer me.\n",
      "There is no one like you among the gods, Lord, nor any deeds like your deeds.\n",
      "All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord. They shall glorify your name.\n",
      "For you are great, and do wondrous things. You are God alone.\n",
      "Teach me your way, Yahweh. I will walk in your truth. Make my heart undivided to fear your name.\n",
      "I will praise you, Lord my God, with my whole heart. I will glorify your name forever more.\n",
      "For your loving kindness is great toward me. You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.\n",
      "God, the proud have risen up against me. A company of violent men have sought after my soul, and they don’t hold regard for you before them.\n",
      "But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth.\n",
      "Turn to me, and have mercy on me! Give your strength to your servant. Save the son of your handmaid.\n",
      "Show me a sign of your goodness, that those who hate me may see it, and be shamed, because you, Yahweh, have helped me, and comforted me.\n",
      "His foundation is in the holy mountains.\n",
      "Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\n",
      "Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. Selah.\n",
      "I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me. Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia: “This one was born there.”\n",
      "Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her”; the Most High himself will establish her.\n",
      "Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah.\n",
      "Those who sing as well as those who dance say, “All my springs are in you.”\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before you.\n",
      "Let my prayer enter into your presence. Turn your ear to my cry.\n",
      "For my soul is full of troubles. My life draws near to Sheol.\n",
      "I am counted among those who go down into the pit. I am like a man who has no help,\n",
      "set apart among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more. They are cut off from your hand.\n",
      "You have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.\n",
      "Your wrath lies heavily on me. You have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah.\n",
      "You have taken my friends from me. You have made me an abomination to them. I am confined, and I can’t escape.\n",
      "My eyes are dim from grief. I have called on you daily, Yahweh. I have spread out my hands to you.\n",
      "Do you show wonders to the dead? Do the departed spirits rise up and praise you? Selah.\n",
      "Is your loving kindness declared in the grave? Or your faithfulness in Destruction?\n",
      "Are your wonders made known in the dark? Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?\n",
      "But to you, Yahweh, I have cried. In the morning, my prayer comes before you.\n",
      "Yahweh, why do you reject my soul? Why do you hide your face from me?\n",
      "I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.\n",
      "Your fierce wrath has gone over me. Your terrors have cut me off.\n",
      "They came around me like water all day long. They completely engulfed me.\n",
      "You have put lover and friend far from me, and my friends into darkness.\n",
      "I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever. With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.\n",
      "I indeed declare, “Love stands firm forever. You established the heavens. Your faithfulness is in them.”\n",
      "“I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David, my servant,\n",
      "‘I will establish your offspring forever, and build up your throne to all generations.’” Selah.\n",
      "The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.\n",
      "For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh? Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh,\n",
      "a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones, to be feared above all those who are around him?\n",
      "Yahweh, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you? Yah, your faithfulness is around you.\n",
      "You rule the pride of the sea. When its waves rise up, you calm them.\n",
      "You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain. You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.\n",
      "The heavens are yours. The earth also is yours; the world and its fullness. You have founded them.\n",
      "The north and the south, you have created them. Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.\n",
      "You have a mighty arm. Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.\n",
      "Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loving kindness and truth go before your face.\n",
      "Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you. They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.\n",
      "In your name they rejoice all day. In your righteousness, they are exalted.\n",
      "For you are the glory of their strength. In your favor, our horn will be exalted.\n",
      "For our shield belongs to Yahweh; our king to the Holy One of Israel.\n",
      "Then you spoke in vision to your saints, and said, “I have given strength to the warrior. I have exalted a young man from the people.\n",
      "I have found David, my servant. I have anointed him with my holy oil,\n",
      "with whom my hand shall be established. My arm will also strengthen him.\n",
      "No enemy will tax him. No wicked man will oppress him.\n",
      "I will beat down his adversaries before him, and strike those who hate him.\n",
      "But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him. In my name, his horn will be exalted.\n",
      "I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.\n",
      "He will call to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation!’\n",
      "I will also appoint him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.\n",
      "I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more. My covenant will stand firm with him.\n",
      "I will also make his offspring endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.\n",
      "If his children forsake my law, and don’t walk in my ordinances;\n",
      "if they break my statutes, and don’t keep my commandments;\n",
      "then I will punish their sin with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.\n",
      "But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him, nor allow my faithfulness to fail.\n",
      "I will not break my covenant, nor alter what my lips have uttered.\n",
      "Once have I sworn by my holiness, I will not lie to David.\n",
      "His offspring will endure forever, his throne like the sun before me.\n",
      "It will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky.” Selah.\n",
      "But you have rejected and spurned. You have been angry with your anointed.\n",
      "You have renounced the covenant of your servant. You have defiled his crown in the dust.\n",
      "You have broken down all his hedges. You have brought his strongholds to ruin.\n",
      "All who pass by the way rob him. He has become a reproach to his neighbors.\n",
      "You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries. You have made all of his enemies rejoice.\n",
      "Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword, and haven’t supported him in battle.\n",
      "You have ended his splendor, and thrown his throne down to the ground.\n",
      "You have shortened the days of his youth. You have covered him with shame. Selah.\n",
      "How long, Yahweh? Will you hide yourself forever? Will your wrath burn like fire?\n",
      "Remember how short my time is! For what vanity have you created all the children of men!\n",
      "What man is he who shall live and not see death, who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.\n",
      "Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses, which you swore to David in your faithfulness?\n",
      "Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,\n",
      "With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh, with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.\n",
      "Blessed be Yahweh forever more. Amen, and Amen.\n",
      "Lord, you have been our dwelling place for all generations.\n",
      "Before the mountains were born, before you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.\n",
      "You turn man to destruction, saying, “Return, you children of men.”\n",
      "For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past, like a watch in the night.\n",
      "You sweep them away as they sleep. In the morning they sprout like new grass.\n",
      "In the morning it sprouts and springs up. By evening, it is withered and dry.\n",
      "For we are consumed in your anger. We are troubled in your wrath.\n",
      "You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.\n",
      "For all our days have passed away in your wrath. We bring our years to an end as a sigh.\n",
      "The days of our years are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty years; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for it passes quickly, and we fly away.\n",
      "Who knows the power of your anger, your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?\n",
      "So teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.\n",
      "Relent, Yahweh! How long? Have compassion on your servants!\n",
      "Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.\n",
      "Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil.\n",
      "Let your work appear to your servants; your glory to their children.\n",
      "Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us; establish the work of our hands for us; yes, establish the work of our hands.\n",
      "He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.\n",
      "I will say of Yahweh, “He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.”\n",
      "For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.\n",
      "He will cover you with his feathers. Under his wings you will take refuge. His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.\n",
      "You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day;\n",
      "nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.\n",
      "A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it will not come near you.\n",
      "You will only look with your eyes, and see the recompense of the wicked.\n",
      "Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, and the Most High your dwelling place,\n",
      "no evil shall happen to you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.\n",
      "For he will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you in all your ways.\n",
      "They will bear you up in their hands, so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone.\n",
      "You will tread on the lion and cobra. You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.\n",
      "“Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him. I will set him on high, because he has known my name.\n",
      "He will call on me, and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him, and honor him.\n",
      "I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my salvation.”\n",
      "It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh, to sing praises to your name, Most High;\n",
      "to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, and your faithfulness every night,\n",
      "with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, and with the melody of the lyre.\n",
      "For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands.\n",
      "How great are your works, Yahweh! Your thoughts are very deep.\n",
      "A senseless man doesn’t know, neither does a fool understand this:\n",
      "though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever.\n",
      "But you, Yahweh, are on high forever more.\n",
      "For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for, behold, your enemies shall perish. All the evildoers will be scattered.\n",
      "But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. I am anointed with fresh oil.\n",
      "My eye has also seen my enemies. My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me.\n",
      "The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.\n",
      "They are planted in Yahweh’s house. They will flourish in our God’s courts.\n",
      "They will still produce fruit in old age. They will be full of sap and green,\n",
      "to show that Yahweh is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.\n",

      "As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.\n",
      "Like a father has compassion on his children, so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him.\n",
      "For he knows how we are made. He remembers that we are dust.\n",
      "As for man, his days are like grass. As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.\n",
      "For the wind passes over it, and it is gone. Its place remembers it no more.\n",

      "He makes his messengers winds; his servants flames of fire.\n",
      "He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved forever.\n",
      "You covered it with the deep as with a cloak. The waters stood above the mountains.\n",
      "At your rebuke they fled. At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.\n",
      "The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place which you had assigned to them.\n",
      "You have set a boundary that they may not pass over; that they don’t turn again to cover the earth.\n",
      "He sends springs into the valleys. They run among the mountains.\n",
      "They give drink to every animal of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.\n",
      "The birds of the sky nest by them. They sing among the branches.\n",
      "He waters the mountains from his rooms. The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.\n",
      "He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for man to cultivate, that he may produce food out of the earth:\n",
      "wine that makes glad the heart of man, oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengthens man’s heart.\n",
      "Yahweh’s trees are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;\n",
      "where the birds make their nests. The stork makes its home in the fir trees.\n",
      "The high mountains are for the wild goats. The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.\n",
      "He appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows when to set.\n",
      "You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the animals of the forest prowl.\n",
      "The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.\n",
      "The sun rises, and they steal away, and lay down in their dens.\n",
      "Man goes out to his work, to his labor until the evening.\n",
      "Yahweh, how many are your works! In wisdom have you made them all. The earth is full of your riches.\n",
      "There is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable living things, both small and large animals.\n",
      "There the ships go, and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.\n",
      "These all wait for you, that you may give them their food in due season.\n",
      "You give to them; they gather. You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.\n",
      "You hide your face: they are troubled; you take away their breath: they die, and return to the dust.\n",
      "You send out your Spirit and they are created. You renew the face of the ground.\n",
      "Let Yahweh’s glory endure forever. Let Yahweh rejoice in his works.\n",
      "He looks at the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.\n",

      "Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his face forever more.\n",
      "Remember his marvelous works that he has done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,\n",
      "you offspring of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.\n",
      "He is Yahweh, our God. His judgments are in all the earth.\n",
      "He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,\n",
      "the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac,\n",
      "and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute; to Israel for an everlasting covenant,\n",
      "saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance”;\n",
      "when they were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners in it.\n",
      "They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.\n",
      "He allowed no one to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,\n",
      "“Don’t touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!”\n",
      "He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies.\n",
      "He sent a man before them. Joseph was sold for a slave.\n",
      "They bruised his feet with shackles. His neck was locked in irons,\n",
      "until the time that his word happened, and Yahweh’s word proved him true.\n",
      "The king sent and freed him; even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.\n",
      "He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions;\n",
      "to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.\n",
      "Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob lived in the land of Ham.\n",
      "He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.\n",
      "He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.\n",
      "He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.\n",
      "They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.\n",
      "He sent darkness, and made it dark. They didn’t rebel against his words.\n",
      "He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.\n",
      "Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the rooms of their kings.\n",
      "He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.\n",
      "He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.\n",
      "He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.\n",
      "He spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, without number,\n",
      "ate up every plant in their land; and ate up the fruit of their ground.\n",

      "For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.\n",
      "He brought his people out with joy, his chosen with singing.\n",
      "He gave them the lands of the nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession,\n",
      "that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise Yah!\n",
      "Praise Yahweh! Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.\n",

      "We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.\n",
      "Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt. They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.\n",
      "Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power known.\n",
      "He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.\n",
      "He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.\n",
      "The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left.\n",
      "Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.\n",
      "They soon forgot his works. They didn’t wait for his counsel,\n",

      "He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.\n",
      "They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh’s saint.\n",
      "The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.\n",
      "A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.\n",
      "They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.\n",
      "Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass.\n",
      "They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,\n",
      "Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea.\n",
      "Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.\n",
      "Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They didn’t believe his word,\n",
      "but murmured in their tents, and didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice.\n",
      "Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,\n",
      "that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.\n",
      "They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.\n",
      "Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.\n",
      "Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped.\n",
      "That was credited to him for righteousness, for all generations to come.\n",
      "They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;\n",
      "because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.\n",
      "They didn’t destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,\n",
      "but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.\n",
      "They served their idols, which became a snare to them.\n",
      "Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.\n",
      "They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.\n",
      "Thus were they defiled with their works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.\n",
      "He gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.\n",
      "Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand.\n",
      "Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.\n",
      "Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.\n",
      "He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.\n",
      "He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.\n",
      "Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!\n",

      "They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city to live in.\n",
      "Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.\n",
      "Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses,\n",
      "he led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city to live in.\n",
      "Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!\n",
      "For he satisfies the longing soul. He fills the hungry soul with good.\n",
      "Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron,\n",

      "Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those who hate Zion.\n",
      "Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up;\n",
      "with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.\n",

      "He will redeem Israel from all their sins.\n",
      "Yahweh, my heart isn’t haughty, nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too wonderful for me.\n",
      "Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.\n",
      "Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forward and forever more.\n",
      "Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,\n",
      "how he swore to Yahweh, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:\n",
      "“Surely I will not come into the structure of my house, nor go up into my bed;\n",
      "I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids;\n",
      "until I find out a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”\n",
      "Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah. We found it in the field of Jaar:\n",

      "There I will make the horn of David to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.\n",
      "I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself, his crown will be resplendent.”\n",
      "See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity!\n",
      "It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron’s beard; that came down on the edge of his robes;\n",
      "like the dew of Hermon, that comes down on the hills of Zion: for there Yahweh gives the blessing, even life forever more.\n",
      "Look! Praise Yahweh, all you servants of Yahweh, who stand by night in Yahweh’s house!\n",
      "Lift up your hands in the sanctuary. Praise Yahweh!\n",

      "Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;\n",
      "who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth; who makes lightnings with the rain; who brings the wind out of his treasuries;\n",
      "Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and animal;\n",
      "Who sent signs and wonders into the middle of you, Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his servants;\n",
      "who struck many nations, and killed mighty kings,\n",
      "Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan,\n",
      "and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel, his people.\n",
      "Your name, Yahweh, endures forever; your renown, Yahweh, throughout all generations.\n",
      "For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion on his servants.\n",
      "The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.\n",
      "They have mouths, but they can’t speak. They have eyes, but they can’t see.\n",
      "They have ears, but they can’t hear; neither is there any breath in their mouths.\n",

      "Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle.\n",
      "Yahweh, don’t grant the desires of the wicked. Don’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah.\n",
      "As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.\n",
      "Let burning coals fall on them. Let them be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, from where they never rise.\n",
      "An evil speaker won’t be established in the earth. Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.\n",
      "I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and justice for the needy.\n",
      "Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name. The upright will dwell in your presence.\n",
      "Yahweh, I have called on you. Come to me quickly! Listen to my voice when I call to you.\n",
      "Let my prayer be set before you like incense; the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.\n",
      "Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth. Keep the door of my lips.\n",
      "Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity. Don’t let me eat of their delicacies.\n",

      "Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.\n",
      "“As when one plows and breaks up the earth, our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.”\n",
      "For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord. In you, I take refuge. Don’t leave my soul destitute.\n",
      "Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, from the traps of the workers of iniquity.\n",
      "Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, while I pass by.\n",
      "I cry with my voice to Yahweh. With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.\n",
      "I pour out my complaint before him. I tell him my troubles.\n",

      "Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes downward to the earth?”\n",
      "Therefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who can bring him to see what will be after him?\n",
      "Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.\n",
      "Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive.\n",
      "Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.\n",
      "Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man’s neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.\n",
      "The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.\n",
      "Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind.\n",
      "Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.\n",
      "There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. “For whom then, do I labor, and deprive my soul of enjoyment?” This also is vanity. Yes, it is a miserable business.\n",
      "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.\n",
      "For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn’t have another to lift him up.\n",
      "Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?\n",
      "If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.\n",
      "Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn’t know how to receive admonition any more.\n",
      "For out of prison he came out to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor.\n",
      "I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.\n",
      "There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was—yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.\n",
      "Guard your steps when you go to God’s house; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they don’t know that they do evil.\n",
      "Don’t be rash with your mouth, and don’t let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and you on earth. Therefore let your words be few.\n",
      "For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool’s speech with a multitude of words.\n",
      "When you vow a vow to God, don’t defer to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you vow.\n",
      "It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.\n",
      "Don’t allow your mouth to lead you into sin. Don’t protest before the messenger that this was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?\n",
      "For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well as in many words: but you must fear God.\n",
      "If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a district, don’t marvel at the matter: for one official is eyed by a higher one; and there are officials over them.\n",
      "Moreover the profit of the earth is for all. The king profits from the field.\n",
      "He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.\n",
      "When goods increase, those who eat them are increased; and what advantage is there to its owner, except to feast on them with his eyes?\n",
      "The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.\n",
      "There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm.\n",
      "Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son, there is nothing in his hand.\n",
      "As he came out of his mother’s womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.\n",
      "This also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he have who labors for the wind?\n",
      "All his days he also eats in darkness, he is frustrated, and has sickness and wrath.\n",
      "Behold, that which I have seen to be good and proper is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, in which he labors under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him; for this is his portion.\n",
      "Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God.\n",
      "For he shall not often reflect on the days of his life; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.\n",
      "There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy on men:\n",
      "a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God gives him no power to eat of it, but an alien eats it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.\n",
      "If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say, that a stillborn child is better than he:\n",
      "for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.\n",
      "Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it. This has rest rather than the other.\n",
      "Yes, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet fails to enjoy good, don’t all go to one place?\n",
      "All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.\n",
      "For what advantage has the wise more than the fool? What has the poor man, that knows how to walk before the living?\n",
      "Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.\n",
      "Whatever has been, its name was given long ago; and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he.\n",
      "For there are many words that create vanity. What does that profit man?\n",
      "For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?\n",
      "A good name is better than fine perfume; and the day of death better than the day of one’s birth.\n",
      "It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men, and the living should take this to heart.\n",
      "Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good.\n",
      "The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.\n",
      "It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.\n",
      "For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.\n",
      "Surely extortion makes the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroys the understanding.\n",
      "Better is the end of a thing than its beginning. The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.\n",
      "Don’t be hasty in your spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools.\n",
      "Don’t say, “Why were the former days better than these?” For you do not ask wisely about this.\n",
      "Wisdom is as good as an inheritance. Yes, it is more excellent for those who see the sun.\n",
      "For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense; but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.\n",
      "Consider the work of God, for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?\n",
      "In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yes, God has made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything after him.\n",
      "All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing.\n",
      "Don’t be overly righteous, neither make yourself overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself?\n",
      "Don’t be too wicked, neither be foolish. Why should you die before your time?\n",
      "It is good that you should take hold of this. Yes, also from that don’t withdraw your hand; for he who fears God will come out of them all.\n",
      "Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.\n",
      "Surely there is not a righteous man on earth, who does good and doesn’t sin.\n",
      "Also don’t take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you;\n",
      "for often your own heart knows that you yourself have likewise cursed others.\n",
      "All this have I proved in wisdom. I said, “I will be wise”; but it was far from me.\n",
      "That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep. Who can find it out?\n",
      "I turned around, and my heart sought to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know that wickedness is stupidity, and that foolishness is madness.\n",
      "I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and traps, whose hands are chains. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner will be ensnared by her.\n",
      "“Behold, I have found this, ” says the Preacher, “to one another, to find out the scheme;\n",
      "which my soul still seeks; but I have not found. One man among a thousand have I found; but I have not found a woman among all those.\n",
      "Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they search for many schemes.”\n",
      "Who is like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man’s wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.\n",
      "I say, “Keep the king’s command!” because of the oath to God.\n",
      "Don’t be hasty to go out of his presence. Don’t persist in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him,\n",
      "for the king’s word is supreme. Who can say to him, “What are you doing?”\n",
      "Whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm, and his wise heart will know the time and procedure.\n",
      "For there is a time and procedure for every purpose, although the misery of man is heavy on him.\n",
      "For he doesn’t know that which will be; for who can tell him how it will be?\n",
      "There is no man who has power over the spirit to contain the spirit; neither does he have power over the day of death. There is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver those who practice it.\n",
      "All this have I seen, and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt.\n",
      "So I saw the wicked buried. Indeed they came also from holiness. They went and were forgotten in the city where they did this. This also is vanity.\n",
      "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.\n",
      "Though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long, yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him.\n",
      "But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow; because he doesn’t fear God.\n",
      "There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked. Again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.\n",
      "Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.\n",
      "When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes),\n",
      "then I saw all the work of God, that man can’t find out the work that is done under the sun, because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won’t find it. Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it, he won’t be able to find it.\n",
      "For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn’t know it; all is before them.\n",
      "All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean, to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn’t sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath, as he who fears an oath.\n",
      "This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.\n",
      "For to him who is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.\n",
      "For the living know that they will die, but the dead don’t know anything, neither do they have any more a reward; for their memory is forgotten.\n",
      "Also their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.\n",
      "Go your way—eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.\n",
      "Let your garments be always white, and don’t let your head lack oil.\n",
      "Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your life of vanity, which he has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity: for that is your portion in life, and in your labor in which you labor under the sun.\n",
      "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, where you are going.\n",
      "I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.\n",
      "For man also doesn’t know his time. As the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.\n",
      "I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it seemed great to me.\n",
      "There was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.\n",
      "Now a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.\n",
      "Then I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” Nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.\n",
      "The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him who rules among fools.\n",
      "Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good.\n",
      "Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to produce an evil odor; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.\n",
      "A wise man’s heart is at his right hand, but a fool’s heart at his left.\n",
      "Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.\n",
      "If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don’t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.\n",
      "There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.\n",
      "Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.\n",
      "I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.\n",
      "He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.\n",
      "Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby.\n",
      "If the ax is blunt, and one doesn’t sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.\n",
      "If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer’s tongue.\n",
      "The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.\n",
      "The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.\n",
      "A fool also multiplies words. Man doesn’t know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?\n",
      "The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn’t know how to go to the city.\n",
      "Woe to you, land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!\n",
      "Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!\n",
      "By slothfulness the roof sinks in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.\n",
      "A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes the life glad; and money is the answer for all things.\n",
      "Don’t curse the king, no, not in your thoughts; and don’t curse the rich in your bedroom: for a bird of the sky may carry your voice, and that which has wings may tell the matter.\n",
      "Cast your bread on the waters; for you shall find it after many days.\n",
      "Give a portion to seven, yes, even to eight; for you don’t know what evil will be on the earth.\n",
      "If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth; and if a tree falls toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there shall it be.\n",
      "He who observes the wind won’t sow; and he who regards the clouds won’t reap.\n",
      "As you don’t know what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child; even so you don’t know the work of God who does all.\n",
      "In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening don’t withhold your hand; for you don’t know which will prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both will be equally good.\n",
      "Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun.\n",
      "Yes, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that comes is vanity.\n",
      "Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.\n",
      "Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.\n",
      "Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw near, when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;\n",
      "Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;\n",
      "in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look out of the windows are darkened,\n",
      "and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;\n",
      "yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be on the way; and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:\n",
      "before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the spring, or the wheel broken at the cistern,\n",
      "and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.\n",
      "“Vanity of vanities, ” says the Preacher. “All is vanity!”\n",
      "Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs.\n",
      "The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.\n",
      "The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.\n",
      "Furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.\n",
      "This is the end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.\n",
      "For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.\n",
      "The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s.\n",
      "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for your love is better than wine.\n",
      "Your oils have a pleasing fragrance. Your name is oil poured out, therefore the virgins love you.\n",
      "Take me away with you. Let us hurry. The king has brought me into his rooms. We will be glad and rejoice in you. We will praise your love more than wine! They are right to love you.\n",
      "I am dark, but lovely, you daughters of Jerusalem, like Kedar’s tents, like Solomon’s curtains.\n",
      "Don’t stare at me because I am dark, because the sun has scorched me. My mother’s sons were angry with me. They made me keeper of the vineyards. I haven’t kept my own vineyard.\n",
      "Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you graze your flock, where you rest them at noon; For why should I be as one who is veiled beside the flocks of your companions?\n",
      "If you don’t know, most beautiful among women, follow the tracks of the sheep. Graze your young goats beside the shepherds’ tents.\n",
      "I have compared you, my love, to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.\n",
      "Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.\n",
      "We will make you earrings of gold, with studs of silver.\n",
      "While the king sat at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.\n",
      "My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh, that lies between my breasts.\n",
      "My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.\n",
      "Behold, you are beautiful, my love. Behold, you are beautiful. Your eyes are doves.\n",
      "Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant; and our couch is verdant.\n",
      "The beams of our house are cedars. Our rafters are firs.\n",
      "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.\n",
      "As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.\n",
      "As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, his fruit was sweet to my taste.\n",
      "He brought me to the banquet hall. His banner over me is love.\n",
      "Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am faint with love.\n",
      "His left hand is under my head. His right hand embraces me.\n",
      "I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires.\n",
      "The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.\n",
      "My beloved is like a roe or a young deer. Behold, he stands behind our wall! He looks in at the windows. He glances through the lattice.\n",
      "My beloved spoke, and said to me, “Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.\n",
      "For, behold, the winter is past. The rain is over and gone.\n",
      "The flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.\n",
      "The fig tree ripens her green figs. The vines are in blossom. They give out their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.”\n",
      "My dove in the clefts of the rock, In the hiding places of the mountainside, Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.\n",
      "Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that plunder the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.\n",
      "My beloved is mine, and I am his. He browses among the lilies.\n",
      "Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether.\n",
      "By night on my bed, I sought him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I didn’t find him.\n",
      "I will get up now, and go about the city; in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I didn’t find him.\n",
      "The watchmen who go about the city found me; “Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”\n",
      "I had scarcely passed from them, when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, into the room of her who conceived me.\n",
      "I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires.\n",
      "Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all spices of the merchant?\n",
      "Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage! Sixty mighty men are around it, of the mighty men of Israel.\n",
      "They all handle the sword, and are expert in war. Every man has his sword on his thigh, because of fear in the night.\n",
      "King Solomon made himself a carriage of the wood of Lebanon.\n",
      "He made its pillars of silver, its bottom of gold, its seat of purple, the middle of it being paved with love, from the daughters of Jerusalem.\n",
      "Go out, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon, with the crown with which his mother has crowned him, in the day of his weddings, in the day of the gladness of his heart.\n",
      "Behold, you are beautiful, my love. Behold, you are beautiful. Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is as a flock of goats, that descend from Mount Gilead.\n",
      "Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock, which have come up from the washing, where every one of them has twins. None is bereaved among them.\n",
      "Your lips are like scarlet thread. Your mouth is lovely. Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.\n",
      "Your neck is like David’s tower built for an armory, whereon a thousand shields hang, all the shields of the mighty men.\n",
      "Your two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe, which feed among the lilies.\n",
      "Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, to the hill of frankincense.\n",
      "You are all beautiful, my love. There is no spot in you.\n",
      "Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.\n",
      "You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride. You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck.\n",
      "How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine! The fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices!\n",
      "Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb. Honey and milk are under your tongue. The smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.\n",
      "A locked up garden is my sister, my bride; a locked up spring, a sealed fountain.\n",
      "Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits: henna with spikenard plants,\n",
      "spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree; myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices,\n",
      "a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, flowing streams from Lebanon.\n",
      "Awake, north wind; and come, you south! Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and taste his precious fruits.\n",
      "I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends! Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.\n",
      "I was asleep, but my heart was awake. It is the voice of my beloved who knocks: “Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, and my hair with the dampness of the night.”\n",
      "I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on? I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?\n",
      "My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening. My heart pounded for him.\n",
      "I rose up to open for my beloved. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the lock.\n",
      "I opened to my beloved; but my beloved left; and had gone away. My heart went out when he spoke. I looked for him, but I didn’t find him. I called him, but he didn’t answer.\n",
      "The watchmen who go about the city found me. They beat me. They bruised me. The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me.\n",
      "I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, that you tell him that I am faint with love.\n",
      "How is your beloved better than another beloved, you fairest among women? How is your beloved better than another beloved, that you do so adjure us?\n",
      "My beloved is white and ruddy. The best among ten thousand.\n",
      "His head is like the purest gold. His hair is bushy, black as a raven.\n",
      "His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, washed with milk, mounted like jewels.\n",
      "His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes. His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.\n",
      "His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl. His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.\n",
      "His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.\n",
      "His mouth is sweetness; yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.\n",
      "Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?\n",
      "My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.\n",
      "I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine. He browses among the lilies,\n",
      "You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners.\n",
      "Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats, that lie along the side of Gilead.\n",
      "Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, which have come up from the washing; of which every one has twins; no one is bereaved among them.\n",
      "Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.\n",
      "There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and virgins without number.\n",
      "My dove, my perfect one, is unique. She is her mother’s only daughter. She is the favorite one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.\n",
      "Who is she who looks out as the morning, beautiful as the moon, clear as the sun, and awesome as an army with banners?\n",
      "I went down into the nut tree grove, to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, and the pomegranates were in flower.\n",
      "Without realizing it, my desire set me with my royal people’s chariots.\n",
      "Return, return, Shulammite! Return, return, that we may gaze at you. Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite, as at the dance of Mahanaim?\n",
      "How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince’s daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman.\n",
      "Your body is like a round goblet, no mixed wine is wanting. Your waist is like a heap of wheat, set about with lilies.\n",
      "Your two breasts are like two fawns, that are twins of a roe.\n",
      "Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.\n",
      "Your head on you is like Carmel. The hair of your head like purple. The king is held captive in its tresses.\n",
      "How beautiful and how pleasant you are, love, for delights!\n",
      "This, your stature, is like a palm tree, your breasts like its fruit.\n",
      "I said, “I will climb up into the palm tree. I will take hold of its fruit.” Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the smell of your breath like apples,\n",
      "Your mouth like the best wine, that goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.\n",
      "I am my beloved’s. His desire is toward me.\n",
      "Come, my beloved, let us go out into the field. Let us lodge in the villages.\n",
      "Let’s go early up to the vineyards. Let’s see whether the vine has budded, its blossom is open, and the pomegranates are in flower. There I will give you my love.\n",
      "The mandrakes produce fragrance. At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old, which I have stored up for you, my beloved.\n",
      "Oh that you were like my brother, who nursed from the breasts of my mother! If I found you outside, I would kiss you; yes, and no one would despise me.\n",
      "I would lead you, bringing you into my mother’s house, who would instruct me. I would have you drink spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate.\n",
      "His left hand would be under my head. His right hand would embrace me.\n",
      "I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires.\n",
      "Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I aroused you. There your mother conceived you. There she was in labor and bore you.\n",
      "Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm; for love is strong as death. Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a very flame of Yahweh.\n",
      "Many waters can’t quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, he would be utterly scorned.\n",
      "We have a little sister. She has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for?\n",
      "If she is a wall, we will build on her a turret of silver. if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.\n",
      "I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, then I was in his eyes like one who found peace.\n",
      "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. He leased out the vineyard to keepers. Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.\n",
      "My own vineyard is before me. The thousand are for you, Solomon; two hundred for those who tend its fruit.\n",
      "You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!\n",
      "Come away, my beloved! Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!\n",
      "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.\n",
      "Hear, heavens, and listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken: “I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.\n",
      "The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master’s crib; but Israel doesn’t know, my people don’t consider.”\n"

      "Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.\n",
      "He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.”\n",
      "I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”\n",
      "He said, “Go, and tell this people, ‘You hear indeed, but don’t understand; and you see indeed, but don’t perceive.’\n",
      "Make the heart of this people fat. Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.”\n",
      "Then I said, “Lord, how long?” He answered, “Until cities are waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land becomes utterly waste,\n",
      "And Yahweh has removed men far away, and the forsaken places are many within the land.\n",
      "If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled; so the holy seed is its stock.”\n",
      "In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.\n",
      "It was told the house of David, saying, “Syria is allied with Ephraim.” His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.\n",
      "Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller’s field.\n",
      "Tell him, ‘Be careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.\n",
      "Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying,\n",
      "“Let’s go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it among ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.”\n",
      "This is what the Lord Yahweh says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.”\n",
      "For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people;\n",
      "and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’”\n",
      "Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,\n",
      "“Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.”\n",
      "But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, neither will I tempt Yahweh.”\n",
      "He said, “Listen now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God also?\n",
      "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.\n",
      "He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good.\n",
      "For before the child knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken.\n",
      "Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.\n",
      "It will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.\n",
      "They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys, in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures.\n",
      "In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.\n",
      "It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;\n",
      "and it shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter: for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left within the land.\n",
      "It will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels, shall be for briers and thorns.\n",
      "People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns.\n",
      "All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.”\n",
      "Yahweh said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen, ‘For Maher Shalal Hash Baz’;\n",
      "and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.”\n",
      "I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Yahweh said to me, “Call his name ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’\n",
      "For before the child knows how to say, ‘My father, ’ and, ‘My mother, ’ the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.”\n",
      "Yahweh spoke to me yet again, saying,\n",
      "“Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;\n",
      "now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River: the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.\n",
      "It will sweep onward into Judah. It will overflow and pass through; it will reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the breadth of your land, Immanuel.\n",
      "Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be shattered!\n",
      "Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand: for God is with us.”\n",
      "For Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,\n",
      "“Don’t say, ‘A conspiracy!’ concerning all about which this people say, ‘A conspiracy!’ neither fear their threats, nor be terrorized.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies is who you must respect as holy. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread.\n",
      "He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\n",
      "Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured.”\n",
      "Wrap up the testimony. Seal the law among my disciples.\n",
      "I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.\n",
      "Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies, who dwells in Mount Zion.\n",
      "When they tell you, “Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter: ” shouldn’t a people consult with their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?\n",
      "Turn to the law and to the testimony! If they don’t speak according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.\n",
      "They will pass through it, very distressed and hungry; and it will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by their God. They will turn their faces upward,\n",
      "and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into thick darkness.\n",
      "But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.\n",
      "The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, on them the light has shined.\n",
      "You have multiplied the nation. You have increased their joy. They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder.\n",
      "For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian.\n",
      "For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle, and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire.\n",
      "For to us a child is born. To us a son is given; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\n",
      "Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on the throne of David, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.\n",
      "The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it falls on Israel.\n",
      "All the people will know, including Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,\n",
      "“The bricks have fallen, but we will build with cut stone. The sycamore fig trees have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.”\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,\n",
      "The Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind; and they will devour Israel with open mouth. For all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.\n",
      "Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them, neither have they sought Yahweh of Armies.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed, in one day.\n",
      "The elder and the honorable man is the head, and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail.\n",
      "For those who lead this people lead them astray; and those who are led by them are destroyed.\n",
      "Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is profane and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.\n",
      "For wickedness burns like a fire. It devours the briers and thorns; yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.\n",
      "Through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies, the land is burnt up; and the people are the fuel for the fire. No one spares his brother.\n",
      "One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry; and he will eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied. Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm:\n",
      "Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.\n",
      "Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers who write oppressive decrees;\n",
      "to deprive the needy from justice, and to rob the poor among my people of their rights, that widows may be their plunder, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!\n",
      "What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth?\n",
      "They will only bow down under the prisoners, and will fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.\n",
      "Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation!\n",
      "I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people who anger me will I give him a command to take the plunder and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.\n",
      "However he doesn’t mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations.\n",
      "For he says, “Aren’t all of my princes kings?\n",
      "Isn’t Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like Damascus?”\n",
      "As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;\n",
      "shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?\n",
      "Therefore it will happen that, when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the insolence of his haughty looks.\n",
      "For he has said, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding: and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.\n",
      "My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, have I gathered all the earth. There was no one who moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped.”\n",
      "Should an ax brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood.\n",
      "Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire.\n",
      "The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.\n",
      "He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when a standard bearer faints.\n",
      "The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child could write their number.\n",
      "It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.\n",
      "A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.\n",
      "For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.\n",
      "For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will make a full end, and that determined, throughout all the earth.\n",
      "Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says “My people who dwell in Zion, don’t be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you, as Egypt did.\n",
      "For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed to his destruction.”\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt.\n",
      "It will happen in that day, that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.\n",
      "He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage.\n",
      "They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled.\n",
      "Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor Anathoth!\n",
      "Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.\n",
      "This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.\n",
      "Behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.\n",
      "He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.\n",
      "A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit.\n",
      "Yahweh’s Spirit will rest on him: the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh.\n",
      "His delight will be in the fear of Yahweh. He will not judge by the sight of his eyes, neither decide by the hearing of his ears;\n",
      "but with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide with equity for the humble of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.\n",
      "Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his waist.\n",
      "The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat; The calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together; and a little child will lead them.\n",
      "The cow and the bear will graze. Their young ones will lie down together. The lion will eat straw like the ox.\n",
      "The nursing child will play near a cobra’s hole, and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper’s den.\n",
      "They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.\n",
      "It will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be glorious.\n",
      "It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.\n",
      "He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.\n",
      "The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute Judah will be cut off. Ephraim won’t envy Judah, and Judah won’t persecute Ephraim.\n",
      "They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west. Together they will plunder the children of the east. They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon will obey them.\n",
      "Yahweh will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River, and will split it into seven streams, and cause men to march over in sandals.\n",
      "There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "In that day you will say, “I will give thanks to you, Yahweh; for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me.\n",
      "Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.”\n",
      "Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation.\n",
      "In that day you will say, “Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted!\n",
      "Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth!\n",
      "Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One of Israel is great among you!”\n",
      "The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:\n",

      "I have commanded my consecrated ones; yes, I have called my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly exulting ones.\n",
      "The noise of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people; the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Yahweh of Armies is mustering the army for the battle.\n",
      "They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even Yahweh, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.\n",
      "Wail; for the day of Yahweh is at hand! It will come as destruction from the Almighty.\n",
      "Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone’s heart will melt.\n",
      "They will be dismayed. Pangs and sorrows will seize them. They will be in pain like a woman in labor. They will look in amazement one at another. Their faces will be faces of flame.\n",
      "Behold, the day of Yahweh comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation, and to destroy its sinners out of it.\n",
      "For the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light. The sun will be darkened in its going out, and the moon will not cause its light to shine.\n",
      "I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible.\n",
      "I will make people more rare than fine gold, even a person than the pure gold of Ophir.\n",
      "Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place in the wrath of Yahweh of Armies, and in the day of his fierce anger.\n",
      "It will happen that like a hunted gazelle, and like sheep that no one gathers, they will each turn to their own people, and will each flee to their own land.\n",

      "Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans’ pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.\n",
      "It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from generation to generation. The Arabian will not pitch a tent there, neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there.\n",
      "But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their houses will be full of jackals. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there.\n",
      "Wolves will cry in their castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come, and her days will not be prolonged.\n",
      "For Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land. The foreigner will join himself with them, and they will unite with the house of Jacob.\n",
      "The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place. The house of Israel will possess them in Yahweh’s land for servants and for handmaids. They will take as captives those whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.\n",
      "It will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow, from your trouble, and from the hard service in which you were made to serve,\n",

      "In their streets, they clothe themselves in sackcloth. In their streets and on their housetops, everyone wails, weeping abundantly.\n",
      "Heshbon cries out with Elealeh. Their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud. Their souls tremble within them.\n",
      "My heart cries out for Moab! Her nobles flee to Zoar, to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping; for on the way to Horonaim, they raise up a cry of destruction.\n",
      "For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing.\n",
      "Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have stored up, over the brook of the willows.\n",
      "For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab; its wailing to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim.\n",

      "The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria. They will be as the glory of the children of Israel, ” says Yahweh of Armies.\n",
      "“It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh will become lean.\n",
      "It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his arm reaps the grain. Yes, it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim.\n",
      "Yet gleanings will be left there, like the shaking of an olive tree, two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree, ” says Yahweh, the God of Israel.\n",
      "In that day, people will look to their Maker, and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel.\n",
      "They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made, either the Asherah poles, or the incense altars.\n",
      "In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel; and it will be a desolation.\n",
      "For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not remembered the rock of your strength. Therefore you plant pleasant plants, and set out foreign seedlings.\n",
      "In the day of your planting, you hedge it in. In the morning, you make your seed blossom, but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.\n",
      "Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!\n",

      "that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus on the waters, saying, “Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide!”\n",
      "All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth, when a banner is lifted up on the mountains, look! When the trumpet is blown, listen!\n",
      "For Yahweh said to me, “I will be still, and I will see in my dwelling place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”\n",
      "For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches.\n",
      "They will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains, and for the animals of the earth. The ravenous birds will summer on them, and all the animals of the earth will winter on them.\n",

      "The spirit of Egypt will fail within it. I will destroy its counsel. They will seek the idols, the charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.\n",
      "I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them, ” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.\n",
      "The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry.\n",
      "The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away.\n",
      "The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.\n",
      "The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.\n",
      "Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded.\n",
      "The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul.\n",
      "The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?”\n",
      "Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.\n",
      "The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, who are the cornerstone of her tribes.\n",

      "Yahweh said, “As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia,\n",
      "so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.\n",
      "They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.\n",

      "The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.\n",
      "A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media’s sighing.\n",
      "Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have taken hold on me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am in so much pain that I can’t hear. I so am dismayed that I can’t see.\n",

      "Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people was not. The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin.\n",
      "Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste!\n",
      "It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute.\n",
      "Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered.\n",
      "It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her wages, and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth.\n",
      "Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Yahweh. It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise will be for those who dwell before Yahweh, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.\n",
      "Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.\n",
      "It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest.\n",
      "The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word.\n",

      "The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.\n",
      "It shall happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.\n",
      "They shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.\n",
      "Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders will be glory.\n",
      "Yahweh, you are my God. I will exalt you! I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness and truth.\n",
      "For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city. It will never be built.\n",
      "Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you.\n",
      "For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall.\n",
      "As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low.\n",
      "In this mountain, Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of choice wines, of fat things full of marrow, of well refined choice wines.\n",
      "He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.\n",
      "He has swallowed up death forever! The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces. He will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth, for Yahweh has spoken it.\n",
      "It shall be said in that day, “Behold, this is our God! We have waited for him, and he will save us! This is Yahweh! We have waited for him. We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation!”\n",
      "For in this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest. Moab will be trodden down in his place, even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.\n",
      "He will spread out his hands in the middle of it, like one who swims spreads out hands to swim, but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands.\n",
      "He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.\n",
      "In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: “We have a strong city. God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.\n",
      "Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter: the one which keeps faith.\n",
      "You will keep whoever’s mind is steadfast in perfect peace, because he trusts in you.\n",
      "Trust in Yahweh forever; for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.\n",
      "For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city. He lays it low. He lays it low even to the ground. He brings it even to the dust.\n",
      "The foot shall tread it down; Even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.”\n",
      "The way of the just is uprightness. You who are upright make the path of the righteous level.\n",
      "Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, have we waited for you. Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.\n",
      "With my soul have I desired you in the night. Yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly; for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.\n",
      "Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness. In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not see Yahweh’s majesty.\n",
      "Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don’t see; but they will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed. Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.\n",
      "Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us, for you have also done all our work for us.\n",
      "Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us, but by you only will we make mention of your name.\n",
      "The dead shall not live. The departed spirits shall not rise. Therefore you have visited and destroyed them, and caused all memory of them to perish.\n",
      "You have increased the nation, O Yahweh. You have increased the nation! You are glorified! You have enlarged all the borders of the land.\n",
      "Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you. They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.\n",
      "Like as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs; so we have been before you, Yahweh.\n",
      "We have been with child. We have been in pain. We gave birth, it seems, only to wind. We have not worked any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.\n",
      "Your dead shall live. My dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast out the departed spirits.\n",
      "Come, my people, enter into your rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself for a little moment, until the indignation is past.\n",
      "For, behold, Yahweh comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover her slain.\n",
      "In that day, Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.\n",
      "In that day, sing to her, “A pleasant vineyard!\n",
      "I, Yahweh, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.\n",
      "Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together.\n",
      "Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.”\n",
      "In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.\n",
      "Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?\n",
      "In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.\n",
      "Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more.\n",
      "For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.\n",
      "When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.\n",
      "It will happen in that day, that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.\n",
      "It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.\n",
      "Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine!\n",
      "Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one. Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down to the earth with his hand.\n",
      "The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot.\n",
      "The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it.\n",
      "In that day, Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people;\n",
      "and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.\n",
      "They also reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink. They are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with strong drink. They err in vision. They stumble in judgment.\n",

      "Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem:\n",
      "“Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol are we in agreement. When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’”\n",
      "Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes shall not act hastily.\n",
      "I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place.\n",
      "Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will be trampled down by it.\n",
      "As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.”\n",
      "For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in.\n",
      "For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act, his extraordinary act.\n",
      "Now therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, on the whole earth.\n",
      "Give ear, and hear my voice! Listen, and hear my speech!\n",
      "Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods?\n",
      "When he has leveled its surface, doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place?\n",
      "For his God instructs him in right judgment, and teaches him.\n",
      "For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod.\n",
      "Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it. Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it, his horses don’t grind it.\n",
      "This also comes out from Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.\n",
      "Woe to Ariel! Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts come around;\n",
      "then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be to me as an altar hearth.\n",
      "I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will raise siege works against you.\n",
      "You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.\n",
      "But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.\n",
      "She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder, with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire.\n",
      "The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.\n",
      "It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn’t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that.\n",
      "Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.\n",
      "For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has covered your heads, the seers.\n",
      "All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying, “Read this, please”; and he says, “I can’t, for it is sealed: ”\n",
      "and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, “Read this, please”; and he says, “I can’t read.”\n",
      "The Lord said, “Because this people draws near with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but they have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught;\n",
      "therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.”\n",
      "Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh, and whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, “Who sees us?” and “Who knows us?”\n",
      "You turn things upside down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay; that the thing made should say about him who made it, “He didn’t make me”; or the thing formed say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding?”\n",
      "Isn’t it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest?\n",
      "In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness.\n",
      "The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.\n",
      "For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off—\n",
      "who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare for the arbiter in the gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, says concerning the house of Jacob: “Jacob shall no longer be ashamed, neither shall his face grow pale.\n",
      "But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of him, they will sanctify my name. Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.\n",
      "They also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will receive instruction.”\n",
      "“Woe to the rebellious children”, says Yahweh, “who take counsel, but not from me; and who make an alliance, but not with my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin,\n",
      "who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my advice; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!\n",
      "Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.\n",
      "For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes.\n",
      "They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can’t profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.”\n",
      "The burden of the animals of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to an unprofitable people.\n",
      "For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I called her Rahab who sits still.\n",
      "Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.\n",
      "For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear Yahweh’s law;\n",
      "who tell the seers, “Don’t see!” and to the prophets, “Don’t prophesy to us right things. Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy deceits.\n",
      "Get out of the way. Turn aside from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.”\n",
      "Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, “Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it;\n",
      "therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.\n",
      "He will break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there won’t be found among the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.”\n",
      "For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, “You will be saved in returning and rest. Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.” You refused,\n",
      "but you said, “No, for we will flee on horses”; therefore you will flee; and, “We will ride on the swift”; therefore those who pursue you will be swift.\n",
      "One thousand will flee at the threat of one. At the threat of five, you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh will wait, that he may be gracious to you; and therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on you, for Yahweh is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for him.\n",
      "For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. You will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When he hears you, he will answer you.\n",

      "You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as an unclean thing. You shall tell it, “Go away!”\n",
      "He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that day, your livestock will feed in large pastures.\n",
      "The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory feed, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.\n",
      "There shall be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.\n",
      "Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, in the day that Yahweh binds up the fracture of his people, and heals the wound they were struck with.\n",
      "Behold, Yahweh’s name comes from far away, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire.\n",
      "His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples.\n",
      "You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh’s mountain, to Israel’s Rock.\n",
      "Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the descent of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, storm, and hailstones.\n",
      "For through the voice of Yahweh the Assyrian will be dismayed. He will strike him with his rod.\n",
      "Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Yahweh will lay on him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps. He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons.\n",
      "For his burning place has long been ready. Yes, for the king it is prepared. He has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. Yahweh’s breath, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.\n",
      "Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they don’t look to the Holy One of Israel, and they don’t seek Yahweh!\n",
      "Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of those who work iniquity.\n",
      "Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When Yahweh stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall, and they all shall be consumed together.\n",
      "For Yahweh says to me, “As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for their noise, so Yahweh of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.\n",

      "The fool will no longer be called noble, nor the scoundrel be highly respected.\n",
      "For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity, to practice profanity, and to utter error against Yahweh, To make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.\n",
      "The ways of the scoundrel are evil. He devises wicked devices to destroy the humble with lying words, even when the needy speaks right.\n",

      "Then justice will dwell in the wilderness; and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field.\n",
      "The work of righteousness will be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.\n",
      "My people will live in a peaceful habitation, in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting places.\n",

      "How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of those who dwell therein, the animals are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.\n",
      "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and though in a land of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?\n",
      "For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; even they have cried aloud after you: don’t believe them, though they speak beautiful words to you.\n",
      "I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.\n",
      "My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest: she has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.\n",
      "Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her all around? Go, assemble all the animals of the field, bring them to devour.\n",
      "Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.\n",
      "They have made it a desolation; it mourns to me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.\n",
      "Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.\n",
      "They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh says against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.\n",
      "It shall happen, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.\n",
      "It shall happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Yahweh lives; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the middle of my people.\n",
      "But if they will not hear, then I will pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh says to me, Go, and buy yourself a linen belt, and put it on your waist, and don’t put it in water.\n",
      "So I bought a belt according to Yahweh’s word, and put it on my waist.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying,\n",
      "Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.\n",
      "So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me.\n",
      "After many days, Yahweh said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the belt from there, which I commanded you to hide there.\n",
      "Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the belt was marred, it was profitable for nothing.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh says, In this way I will mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.\n",
      "This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing.\n",
      "For as the belt clings to the waist of a man, so have I caused to cling to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, says Yahweh; that they may be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.\n",
      "Therefore you shall speak to them this word: Yahweh, the God of Israel says, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall tell you, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?\n",
      "Then you shall tell them, Yahweh says, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit on David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.\n",
      "I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says Yahweh: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.\n",
      "Hear, and give ear; don’t be proud; for Yahweh has spoken.\n",
      "Give glory to Yahweh your God, before he causes darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, he turns it into the shadow of death, and makes it gross darkness.\n",
      "But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride; and my eye shall weep bitterly, and run down with tears, because Yahweh’s flock is taken captive.\n",
      "Say to the king and to the queen mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headdresses have come down, even the crown of your glory.\n",
      "The cities of the South are shut up, and there is no one to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.\n",
      "Lift up your eyes, and see those who come from the north: where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?\n",
      "What will you say, when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you? shall not sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?\n",
      "If you say in your heart, Why are these things come on me? for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered, and your heels suffer violence.\n",
      "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.\n",
      "Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passes away, by the wind of the wilderness.\n",
      "This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me, says Yahweh; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.\n",
      "Therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face, and your shame shall appear.\n",
      "I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries, and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, Jerusalem! You will not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?\n",
      "Yahweh’s word that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.\n",
      "Judah mourns, and its gates languish, they sit in black on the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.\n",
      "Their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are disappointed and confounded, and cover their heads.\n",
      "Because of the ground which is cracked, because no rain has been in the land, the plowmen are disappointed, they cover their heads.\n",
      "Yes, the hind also in the field calves, and forsakes her young, because there is no grass.\n",
      "The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.\n",
      "Though our iniquities testify against us, work for your name’s sake, Yahweh; for our rebellions are many; we have sinned against you.\n",
      "You hope of Israel, its Savior in the time of trouble, why should you be as a foreigner in the land, and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?\n",
      "Why should you be like a scared man, as a mighty man who can’t save? Yet you, Yahweh, are in the middle of us, and we are called by your name; don’t leave us.\n",
      "Yahweh says to this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Yahweh does not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.\n",
      "Yahweh said to me, Don’t pray for this people for their good.\n",
      "When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.\n",
      "Then I said, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, the prophets tell them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.\n",
      "Then Yahweh said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I didn’t send them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I to them: they prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh says concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, and I didn’t send them, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.\n",
      "The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have no one to bury them—them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them.\n",
      "You shall say this word to them, Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.\n",
      "If I go out into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, those who are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.\n",
      "Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!\n",
      "We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against you.\n",
      "Do not abhor us, for your name’s sake; do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, don’t break your covenant with us.\n",
      "Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the sky give showers? Aren’t you he, Yahweh our God? therefore we will wait for you; for you have made all these things.\n",
      "Then Yahweh said to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind would not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go out.\n",
      "It shall happen, when they tell you, Where shall we go out? Then you shall tell them, Yahweh says: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.\n",
      "I will appoint over them four kinds, says Yahweh: the sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the sky, and the animals of the earth, to devour and to destroy.\n",
      "I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.\n",
      "For who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? or who will bemoan you? or who will turn aside to ask of your welfare?\n",
      "You have rejected me, says Yahweh, you have gone backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand against you, and destroyed you; I am weary with repenting.\n",
      "I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved them of children, I have destroyed my people; they didn’t return from their ways.\n",
      "Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly.\n",
      "She who has borne seven languishes; she has given up the spirit; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she has been disappointed and confounded: and their residue will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; yet everyone of them curses me.\n",
      "Yahweh said, Most certainly I will strengthen you for good; most certainly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.\n",
      "Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?\n",
      "Your substance and your treasures will I give for a plunder without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.\n",
      "I will make them to pass with your enemies into a land which you don’t know; for a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn on you.\n",
      "Yahweh, you know; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; you are patient, so don’t take me away. Know that for your sake I have suffered reproach.\n",
      "Your words were found, and I ate them; and your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, Yahweh, God of Armies.\n",
      "I didn’t sit in the assembly of those who make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of your hand; for you have filled me with indignation.\n",
      "Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? Will you indeed be to me as a deceitful brook, like waters that fail?\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh says, If you return, then I will bring you again, that you may stand before me; and if you take out the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth: they shall return to you, but you shall not return to them.\n",
      "I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall; and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says Yahweh.\n",
      "I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came also to me, saying,\n",
      "You shall not take a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters, in this place.\n",
      "For Yahweh says concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them, and concerning their fathers who became their father in this land:\n",
      "They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung on the surface of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth.\n",
      "For Yahweh says, Don’t enter into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, says Yahweh, even loving kindness and tender mercies.\n",
      "Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;\n",
      "neither shall men break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.\n",
      "You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.\n",
      "For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.\n",
      "It shall happen, when you shall show this people all these words, and they shall tell you, Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?\n",
      "Then you shall tell them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, says Yahweh, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;\n",
      "and you have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold, you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you don’t listen to me:\n",
      "therefore will I cast you out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night; for I will show you no favor.\n",
      "Therefore behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that it shall no more be said, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;\n",
      "but, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries where he had driven them. I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.\n",
      "Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says Yahweh, and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.\n",
      "For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.\n",
      "First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.\n",
      "Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, vanity and things in which there is no profit.\n",
      "Shall a man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods?\n",
      "Therefore behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is Yahweh.\n",
      "The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of your altars;\n",
      "while their children remember their altars and their Asherah poles by the green trees on the high hills.\n",
      "My mountain in the field, I will give your substance and all your treasures for a plunder, and your high places, because of sin, throughout all your borders.\n",
      "You, even of yourself, shall discontinue from your heritage that I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you don’t know: for you have kindled a fire in my anger which shall burn forever.\n",
      "Yahweh says: Cursed is the man who trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from Yahweh.\n",
      "For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited.\n",
      "Blessed is the man who trusts in Yahweh, and whose trust Yahweh is.\n",
      "For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, who spreads out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat comes, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.\n",
      "The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt: who can know it?\n",
      "I, Yahweh, search the mind, I try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.\n",
      "As the partridge that sits on eggs which she has not laid, so is he who gets riches, and not by right; in the middle of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool.\n",
      "A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.\n",
      "Yahweh, the hope of Israel, all who forsake you shall be disappointed. Those who depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Yahweh, the spring of living waters.\n",
      "Heal me, O Yahweh, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for you are my praise.\n",
      "Behold, they tell me, Where is Yahweh’s word? let it come now.\n",
      "As for me, I have not hurried from being a shepherd after you; neither have I desired the woeful day; you know: that which came out of my lips was before your face.\n",
      "Don’t be a terror to me: you are my refuge in the day of evil.\n",
      "Let them be disappointed who persecute me, but let not me be disappointed; let them be dismayed, but don’t let me be dismayed; bring on them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.\n",
      "Thus said Yahweh to me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, through which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;\n",
      "and tell them, Hear Yahweh’s word, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:\n",
      "Yahweh says, Be careful, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;\n",
      "neither carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day, neither do any work: but make the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers.\n",
      "But they didn’t listen, neither turn their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.\n",
      "It shall happen, if you diligently listen to me, says Yahweh, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but to make the Sabbath day holy, to do no work therein;\n",
      "then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain forever.\n",
      "They shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places around Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill country, and from the South, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meal offerings, and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving, to Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "But if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.\n",
      "The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,\n",
      "Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear my words.\n",
      "Then I went down to the potter’s house, and behold, he was making a work on the wheels.\n",
      "When the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,\n",
      "House of Israel, can’t I do with you as this potter? says Yahweh. Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand, house of Israel.\n",
      "At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it;\n",
      "if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.\n",
      "At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;\n",
      "if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they not obey my voice, then I will repent of the good, with which I said I would benefit them.\n",
      "Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Yahweh says: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return you now everyone from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.\n",
      "But they say, It is in vain; for we will walk after our own devices, and we will do everyone after the stubbornness of his evil heart.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh says: Ask now among the nations, who has heard such things; the virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.\n",
      "Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? Shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?\n",
      "For my people have forgotten me, they have burned incense to false gods; and they have been made to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in byways, in a way not built up;\n",
      "to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head.\n",
      "I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.\n",
      "Then they said, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.\n",
      "Give heed to me, Yahweh, and listen to the voice of those who contend with me.\n",
      "Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have dug a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.\n",
      "Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain of death, and their young men struck of the sword in battle.\n",
      "Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you shall bring a troop suddenly on them; for they have dug a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.\n",
      "Yet, Yahweh, you know all their counsel against me to kill me; don’t forgive their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from your sight; but let them be overthrown before you; deal you with them in the time of your anger.\n",
      "Thus said Yahweh, Go, and buy a potter’s earthen bottle, and take some of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests;\n",
      "and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you;\n",
      "and say, Hear Yahweh’s word, kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, which whoever hears, his ears shall tingle.\n",
      "Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods, that they didn’t know, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,\n",
      "and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal; which I didn’t command, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:\n",
      "therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter.\n",
      "I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life: and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth.\n",
      "I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing; everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.\n",
      "I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat everyone the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies, and those who seek their life, shall distress them.\n",
      "Then you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who go with you,\n",
      "and shall tell them, Yahweh of Armies says: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth, until there is no place to bury.\n",
      "Thus will I do to this place, says Yahweh, and to its inhabitants, even making this city as Topheth:\n",
      "and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.\n",
      "Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of Yahweh’s house, and said to all the people:\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it; because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.\n",
      "Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in Yahweh’s house, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.\n",
      "Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "On the next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.\n",
      "For Yahweh says, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.\n",
      "Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all the precious things of it, yes, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them captives, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.\n",
      "You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.\n",
      "Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocks me.\n",
      "For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because Yahweh’s word is made a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day.\n",
      "If I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I can’t.\n",
      "For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, say all my familiar friends, those who watch for my fall; perhaps he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.\n",
      "But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly disappointed, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.\n",
      "But, Yahweh of Armies, who tests the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause.\n",
      "Sing to Yahweh, praise Yahweh; for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.\n",
      "Cursed is the day in which I was born: don’t let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.\n",
      "Cursed is the man who brought news to my father, saying, A boy is born to you; making him very glad.\n",
      "Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew, and didn’t repent: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;\n",
      "because he didn’t kill me from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.\n",
      "Why did I come out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?\n",
      "The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,\n",
      "Please inquire of Yahweh for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon makes war against us: perhaps Yahweh will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.\n",
      "Then Jeremiah said to them, You shall tell Zedekiah:\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of Israel says, Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans who besiege you, without the walls; and I will gather them into the middle of this city.\n",
      "I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation.\n",
      "I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and animal: they shall die of a great pestilence.\n",
      "Afterward, says Yahweh, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, even such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life: and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.\n",
      "To this people you shall say, Yahweh says: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.\n",
      "He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out, and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.\n",
      "For I have set my face on this city for evil, and not for good, says Yahweh: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.\n",
      "Touching the house of the king of Judah, hear Yahweh’s word:\n",
      "House of David, Yahweh says, Execute justice in the morning, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my wrath go out like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.\n",
      "Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, and of the rock of the plain, says Yahweh; you that say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?\n",
      "I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says Yahweh; and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is around her.\n",
      "Thus said Yahweh: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,\n",
      "Say, Hear Yahweh’s word, king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter in by these gates.\n",
      "Yahweh says: Execute justice and righteousness, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence, to the foreigner, the fatherless, nor the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place.\n",
      "For if you do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.\n",
      "But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself, says Yahweh, that this house shall become a desolation.\n",
      "For Yahweh says concerning the house of the king of Judah: You are Gilead to me, the head of Lebanon. Yet surely I will make you a wilderness, cities which are not inhabited.\n",
      "I will prepare destroyers against you, everyone with his weapons; and they shall cut down your choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.\n",
      "Many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Why has Yahweh done thus to this great city?\n",
      "Then they shall answer, Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God, and worshiped other gods, and served them.\n",
      "Don’t weep for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep bitterly for him who goes away; for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.\n",
      "For Yahweh says touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went out of this place: He shall not return there any more.\n",
      "But in the place where they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more.\n",
      "Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his rooms by injustice; who uses his neighbor’s service without wages, and doesn’t give him his hire;\n",
      "who says, I will build me a wide house and spacious rooms, and cuts him out windows; and it is ceiling with cedar, and painted with vermilion.\n",
      "Shall you reign, because you strive to excel in cedar? Didn’t your father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? then it was well with him.\n",
      "He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Wasn’t this to know me? says Yahweh.\n",
      "But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They shall not lament for him, saying Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!\n",
      "He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.\n",
      "Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all your lovers are destroyed.\n",
      "I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear. This has been your way from your youth, that you didn’t obey my voice.\n",
      "The wind shall feed all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then you will be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.\n",
      "Inhabitant of Lebanon, who makes your nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied you will be when pangs come on you, the pain as of a woman in travail!\n",
      "As I live, says Yahweh, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, yet would I pluck you there;\n",
      "and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.\n",
      "I will cast you out, and your mother who bore you, into another country, where you were not born; and there you will die.\n",
      "But to the land t which their soul longs to return, there shall they not return.\n",
      "Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel in which no one delights? why are they cast out, he and his offspring, and are cast into the land which they don’t know?\n",
      "O earth, earth, earth, hear Yahweh’s word.\n",
      "Yahweh says, Write you this man childless, a man who shall not prosper in his days; for no more shall a man of his offspring prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling in Judah.\n",
      "Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says Yahweh.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says against the shepherds who feed my people: You have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings, says Yahweh.\n",
      "I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply.\n",
      "I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.\n",
      "In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name by which he shall be called: Yahweh our righteousness.\n",
      "Therefore behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that they shall no more say, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;\n",
      "but, As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them. They shall dwell in their own land.\n",
      "Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of Yahweh, and because of his holy words.\n",
      "For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right;\n",
      "for both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house have I found their wickedness, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil on them, even the year of their visitation, says Yahweh.\n",
      "I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.\n",
      "In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one returns from his wickedness: they have all become to me as Sodom, and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh of Armies says concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies says, Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Yahweh.\n",
      "They say continually to those who despise me, Yahweh has said, You shall have peace; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come on you.\n",
      "For who has stood in the council of Yahweh, that he should perceive and hear his word? who has marked my word, and heard it?\n",
      "Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out. Yes, a whirling storm. It shall burst on the head of the wicked.\n",
      "Yahweh’s anger shall not return, until he has executed, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly.\n",
      "I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I didn’t speak to them, yet they prophesied.\n",
      "But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.\n",
      "Am I a God at hand, says Yahweh, and not a God afar off?\n",
      "Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? says Yahweh. Don’t I fill heaven and earth? says Yahweh.\n",
      "I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.\n",
      "How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?\n",
      "who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name for Baal.\n",
      "The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? says Yahweh.\n",
      "Isn’t my word like fire? says Yahweh; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?\n",
      "Therefore behold, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh, who steal my words everyone from his neighbor.\n",
      "Behold, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh, who use their tongues, and say, He says.\n",
      "Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says Yahweh, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I didn’t send them, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, says Yahweh.\n",
      "When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of Yahweh? Then you shall tell them, What burden! I will cast you off, says Yahweh.\n",
      "As for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say, The burden of Yahweh, I will even punish that man and his house.\n",
      "You shall say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, What has Yahweh answered? and, What has Yahweh spoken?\n",
      "You shall mention the burden of Yahweh no more: for every man’s own word shall be his burden; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of Yahweh of Armies our God.\n",
      "You shall say to the prophet, What has Yahweh answered you? and, What has Yahweh spoken?\n",
      "But if you say, The burden of Yahweh; therefore Yahweh says: Because you say this word, The burden of Yahweh, and I have sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of Yahweh;\n",
      "therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence:\n",
      "and I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.\n",
      "Yahweh showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs set before Yahweh’s temple, after that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.\n",
      "One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.\n",
      "Then Yahweh said to me, What do you see, Jeremiah? I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that can’t be eaten, they are so bad.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of Israel says: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.\n",
      "For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.\n",
      "I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return to me with their whole heart.\n",
      "As the bad figs, which can’t be eaten, they are so bad, surely Yahweh says, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt,\n",
      "I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.\n",
      "I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.\n",
      "The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),\n",
      "which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:\n",
      "From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, Yahweh’s word has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; but you have not listened.\n",
      "Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened, nor inclined your ear to hear)\n",
      "saying, Return now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even forever more;\n",
      "and don’t go after other gods to serve them or worship them, and don’t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no harm.\n",
      "Yet you have not listened to me, says Yahweh; that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh of Armies says: Because you have not heard my words,\n",
      "behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says Yahweh, and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.\n",
      "Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.\n",
      "This whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.\n",
      "It shall happen, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, says Yahweh, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate forever.\n",
      "I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.\n",
      "For many nations and great kings shall make bondservants of them, even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.\n",
      "For Yahweh says, the God of Israel, to me: take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.\n",
      "They shall drink, and reel back and forth, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.\n",
      "Then took I the cup at Yahweh’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent me:\n",
      "Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and its kings, and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;\n",
      "Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;\n",
      "and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of the Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;\n",
      "Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;\n",
      "and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;\n",

      "and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness;\n",
      "and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;\n",
      "and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the surface of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.\n",
      "You shall tell them, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: Drink, and be drunk, vomit, fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.\n",
      "It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then you shall tell them, Yahweh of Armies says: You shall surely drink.\n",
      "For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says Yahweh of Armies.\n",
      "Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and tell them, Yahweh will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold; he will give a shout, as those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.\n",
      "A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Yahweh has a controversy with the nations; he will enter into judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies says, Behold, evil shall go out from nation to nation, and a great storm shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.\n",
      "The slain of Yahweh shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung on the surface of the ground.\n",
      "Wail, you shepherds, and cry; and wallow in dust, you principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and you shall fall like a goodly vessel.\n",
      "The shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.\n",
      "A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Yahweh lays waste their pasture.\n",
      "The peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.\n",
      "He has left his covert, as the lion; for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression, and because of his fierce anger.\n",
      "In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from Yahweh, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh says: Stand in the court of Yahweh’s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Yahweh’s house, all the words that I command you to speak to them; don’t diminish a word.\n",
      "It may be they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.\n",
      "You shall tell them, Yahweh says: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,\n",
      "to listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them, but you have not listened;\n",
      "then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.\n",
      "The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "When Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You shall surely die.”\n",
      "Why have you prophesied in Yahweh’s name, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? All the people were gathered to Jeremiah in Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to Yahweh’s house; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "Then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.\n",
      "Then spoke Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people, saying, Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.\n",
      "Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey Yahweh your God’s voice; and Yahweh will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you.\n",
      "But as for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as is good and right in your eyes.\n",
      "Only know for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city, and on its inhabitants; for of a truth Yahweh has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.\n",
      "Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy of death; for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God.\n",
      "Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,\n",
      "Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Yahweh of Armies says: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.\n",
      "Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Didn’t he fear Yahweh, and entreat the favor of Yahweh, and Yahweh relented of the disaster which he had pronounced against them? Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls.\n",
      "There was also a man who prophesied in Yahweh’s name, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:\n",
      "and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt:\n",
      "and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt;\n",
      "and they fetched Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.\n",

      "Yahweh says to me: Make bonds and bars, and put them on your neck;\n",
      "and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;\n",
      "and give them a command to their masters, saying, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, You shall tell your masters:\n",
      "I have made the earth, the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give it to whom it seems right to me.\n",
      "Now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him.\n",
      "All the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondservant.\n",
      "It shall happen, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, says Yahweh, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.\n",
      "But as for you, don’t you listen to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon:\n",
      "for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and you should perish.\n",
      "But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that nation will I let remain in their own land, says Yahweh; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.\n",
      "I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.\n",
      "Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?\n",
      "Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.\n",
      "For I have not sent them, says Yahweh, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you, and the prophets who prophesy to you.\n",
      "Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Yahweh says: Don’t listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Yahweh’s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.\n",
      "Don’t listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: why should this city become a desolation?\n",
      "But if they be prophets, and if Yahweh’s word be with them, let them now make intercession to Yahweh of Armies, that the vessels which are left in Yahweh’s house, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, don’t go to Babylon.\n",
      "For Yahweh of Armies says concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,\n",
      "which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn’t take, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;\n",
      "yes, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning the vessels that are left in Yahweh’s house, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:\n",
      "They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, says Yahweh; then I will bring them up, and restore them to this place.\n",
      "That same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in Yahweh’s house, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,\n",
      "Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.\n",
      "Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon:\n",
      "and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon, says Yahweh; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.\n",
      "Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in Yahweh’s house,\n",
      "even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: Yahweh do so; Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Yahweh’s house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon to this place.\n",
      "Nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people:\n",
      "The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.\n",
      "The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall happen, then shall the prophet be known, that Yahweh has truly sent him.\n",
      "Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it.\n",
      "Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Yahweh says: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. The prophet Jeremiah went his way.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,\n",
      "Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Yahweh says: You have broken the bars of wood; but you have made in their place bars of iron.\n",
      "For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the animals of the field also.\n",
      "Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Yahweh has not sent you; but you make this people to trust in a lie.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh says, Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth: this year you shall die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.\n",
      "So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.\n",
      "Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,\n",
      "(after that Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem),\n",
      "by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), saying,\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:\n",
      "Build houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat their fruit.\n",
      "Take wives, and father sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply there, and don’t be diminished.\n",
      "Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it; for in its peace you shall have peace.\n",
      "For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: Don’t let your prophets who are among you, and your diviners, deceive you; neither listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed.\n",
      "For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: I have not sent them, says Yahweh.\n",
      "For Yahweh says, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.\n",
      "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says Yahweh, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope and a future.\n",
      "You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you.\n",
      "You shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart.\n",
      "I will be found by you, says Yahweh, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Yahweh; and I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.\n",
      "Because you have said, Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon;\n",
      "Yahweh says concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who haven’t gone with you into captivity;\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies says: Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that can’t be eaten, they are so bad.\n",
      "I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them;\n",
      "because they have not listened to my words, says Yahweh, with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Hear therefore Yahweh’s word, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall kill them before your eyes;\n",
      "and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;\n",
      "because they have worked folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I didn’t command them; and I am he who knows, and am witness, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,\n",
      "Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in Yahweh’s house, for every man who is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles.\n",
      "Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you,\n",
      "because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long: build houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat their fruit?\n",
      "Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,\n",
      "Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Yahweh says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I didn’t send him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie;\n",
      "therefore Yahweh says, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his offspring; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he see the good that I will do to my people, says Yahweh, because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.\n",
      "The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,\n",
      "Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.\n",
      "For, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.\n",
      "These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.\n",
      "For Yahweh says: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.\n",
      "Ask now, and see whether a man does travail with child: why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?\n",
      "Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.\n",
      "It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant;\n",
      "but they shall serve Yahweh their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.\n",
      "Therefore don’t you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your offspring from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and no one shall make him afraid.\n",
      "For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.\n",
      "For Yahweh says, Your hurt is incurable, and your wound grievous.\n",
      "There is no one to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.\n",
      "All your lovers have forgotten you; they don’t seek you: for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased.\n",
      "Why do you cry for your hurt? Your pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.\n",
      "Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into captivity; and those who plunder you shall be plunder, and all who prey on you will I give for a prey.\n",
      "For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you an outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.\n",
      "Yahweh says: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built on its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited in its own way.\n",
      "Out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.\n",
      "Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.\n",
      "Their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from among them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me? says Yahweh.\n",
      "You shall be my people, and I will be your God.\n",
      "Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out, a sweeping storm: it shall burst on the head of the wicked.\n",
      "The fierce anger of Yahweh will not return, until he has executed, and until he has performed the intentions of his heart. In the latter days you will understand it.\n",
      "At that time, says Yahweh, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.\n",
      "Yahweh says, The people who were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.\n",
      "Yahweh appeared of old to me, saying, Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you.\n",
      "Again will I build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel: again you shall be adorned with your tambourines, and shall go out in the dances of those who make merry.\n",
      "Again you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy its fruit.\n",
      "For there shall be a day, that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise, and let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.\n",
      "For Yahweh says, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish, praise, and say, Yahweh, save your people, the remnant of Israel.\n",
      "Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, along with the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her who travails with child together: a great company shall they return here.\n",
      "They shall come with weeping; and with petitions will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.\n",
      "Hear Yahweh’s word, you nations, and declare it in the islands afar off; and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.\n",
      "For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.\n",
      "They shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow to the goodness of Yahweh, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.\n",
      "Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.\n",
      "I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh says: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.\n",
      "Yahweh says: Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded, says Yahweh; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.\n",
      "There is hope for your latter end, says Yahweh; and your children shall come again to their own border.\n",
      "I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as an untrained calf: turn me, and I shall be turned; for you are Yahweh my God.\n",
      "Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I struck on my thigh: I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth.\n",
      "Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Set up road signs, make guideposts; set your heart toward the highway, even the way by which you went: turn again, virgin of Israel, turn again to these your cities.\n",
      "How long will you go here and there, you backsliding daughter? for Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I shall bring again their captivity: Yahweh bless you, habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.\n",
      "Judah and all its cities shall dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.\n",
      "For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.\n",
      "On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.\n",
      "Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of animal.\n",
      "It shall happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, says Yahweh.\n",
      "In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.\n",
      "But everyone shall die for his own iniquity: every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.\n",
      "Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:\n",
      "not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was a husband to them, says Yahweh.\n",
      "But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says Yahweh: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:\n",
      "and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Yahweh; for they shall all know me, from their least to their greatest, says Yahweh: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.\n",
      "Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar; Yahweh of Armies is his name, says:\n",
      "If these ordinances depart from before me, says Yahweh, then the offspring of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever.\n",
      "Yahweh says: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then I will also cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that the city shall be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.\n",
      "The measuring line shall go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and shall turn about to Goah.\n",
      "The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to Yahweh; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more forever.\n",
      "The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.\n",
      "Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.\n",
      "For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, and say, Yahweh says, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;\n",
      "and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes;\n",
      "and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and he shall be there until I visit him, says Yahweh: though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper?\n",
      "Jeremiah said, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,\n",
      "Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.\n",
      "So Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to Yahweh’s word, and said to me, Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was Yahweh’s word.\n",
      "I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.\n",
      "I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.\n",
      "So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;\n",
      "and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.\n",
      "I commanded Baruch before them, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.\n",
      "For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.\n",
      "Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying,\n",
      "Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for you,\n",
      "who show loving kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Yahweh of Armies is his name;\n",
      "great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:\n",
      "who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among other men; and made yourself a name, as in this day;\n",
      "and brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;\n",
      "and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;\n",
      "and they came in, and possessed it, but they didn’t obey your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them.\n",
      "Behold, the mounds, they have come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what you have spoken has happened; and behold, you see it.\n",
      "You have said to me, Lord Yahweh, Buy the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,\n",
      "Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh says: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:\n",
      "and the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.\n",
      "For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.\n",
      "For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,\n",
      "because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\n",
      "They have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.\n",
      "But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.\n",
      "They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech; which I didn’t command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.\n",
      "Now therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning this city, about which you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:\n",
      "Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:\n",
      "and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:\n",
      "and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their good, and of their children after them:\n",
      "and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.\n",
      "Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.\n",
      "For Yahweh says: Like as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them.\n",
      "Fields shall be bought in this land, about which you say, It is desolate, without man or animal; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.\n",
      "Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Moreover Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it; Yahweh is his name, says:\n",
      "Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great things, and difficult, which you don’t know.\n",
      "For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a defense against the mounds and against the sword;\n",
      "while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city:\n",
      "Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.\n",
      "I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.\n",
      "I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned against me, and by which they have transgressed against me.\n",
      "This city shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure to it.\n",
      "Yahweh says: Yet again there shall be heard in this place, about which you say, It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal,\n",
      "the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies, for Yahweh is good, for his loving kindness endures forever; who bring thanksgiving into Yahweh’s house. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies says: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.\n",
      "In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.\n",
      "In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.\n",
      "In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name by which she shall be called: Yahweh our righteousness.\n",
      "For Yahweh says: David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;\n",
      "neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh says: If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;\n",
      "then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.\n",
      "As the army of the sky can’t be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant, and the Levites who minister to me.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,\n",
      "Don’t consider what this people has spoken, saying, The two families which Yahweh chose, he has cast them off? thus do they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.\n",
      "Yahweh says: If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;\n",
      "then I will also cast away the offspring of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.\n",
      "The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of it, saying:\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Yahweh says, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:\n",
      "and you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.\n",
      "Yet hear Yahweh’s word, O Zedekiah king of Judah: Yahweh says concerning you, You shall not die by the sword;\n",
      "you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so shall they make a burning for you; and they shall lament you, saying, Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,\n",
      "when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.\n",
      "The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;\n",
      "that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that no one should make bondservants of them, of a Jew his brother.\n",
      "All the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant, and everyone his female servant, go free, that no one should make bondservants of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:\n",
      "but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,\n",
      "At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you: but your fathers didn’t listen to me, neither inclined their ear.\n",
      "You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:\n",
      "but you turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and you brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh says: you have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim to you a liberty, says Yahweh, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.\n",
      "I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts;\n",
      "the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf;\n",
      "I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth.\n",
      "Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, who have gone away from you.\n",
      "Behold, I will command, says Yahweh, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.\n",
      "The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,\n",
      "Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into Yahweh’s house, into one of the rooms, and give them wine to drink.\n",
      "Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;\n",
      "and I brought them into Yahweh’s house, into the room of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the room of the princes, which was above the room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.\n",
      "I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, Drink wine!\n",
      "But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons, forever:\n",
      "neither shall you build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents; that you may live many days in the land in which you live.\n",
      "We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;\n",
      "nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:\n",
      "but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.\n",
      "But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, we said, “Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we will dwell at Jerusalem.”\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Go, and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words? says Yahweh.\n",
      "The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment: but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; and you have not listened to me.\n",
      "I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and don’t go after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me.\n",
      "Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me;\n",
      "therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.\n",
      "Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you;\n",
      "therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me forever.\n",
      "In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,\n",
      "Take a scroll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.\n",
      "It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.\n",
      "Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all Yahweh’s words, which he had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book.\n",
      "Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I can’t go into Yahweh’s house:\n",
      "therefore you go, and read in the scroll, which you have written from my mouth, Yahweh’s words in the ears of the people in Yahweh’s house on the fast day; and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.\n",
      "It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will return everyone from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that Yahweh has pronounced against this people.\n",
      "Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book Yahweh’s words in Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh.\n",
      "Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh’s house, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house, in the ears of all the people.\n",
      "When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all Yahweh’s words,\n",
      "he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s room: and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.\n",
      "Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.\n",
      "Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them.\n",
      "They said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.\n",
      "Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.”\n",
      "They asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?\n",
      "Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.\n",
      "Then the princes said to Baruch, Go, hide, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are.\n",
      "They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.\n",
      "So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king.\n",
      "Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month: and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him.\n",
      "When Jehudi had read three or four leaves, the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.\n",
      "They were not afraid, nor tore their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words.\n",
      "Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not hear them.\n",
      "The king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,\n",
      "Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.\n",
      "Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, Yahweh says: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and animal?\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.\n",
      "I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn’t listen.\n",
      "Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.\n",
      "Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.\n",
      "But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, listened to Yahweh’s words, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.\n",
      "Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.\n",
      "Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.\n",
      "Pharaoh’s army had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem.\n",
      "Then came Yahweh’s word to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, You shall tell the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.\n",
      "The Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.\n",
      "Yahweh says, Don’t deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.\n",
      "For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yes would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.\n",
      "When the army of the Chaldeans had broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,\n",
      "then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the middle of the people.\n",
      "When he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are falling away to the Chaldeans.\n",
      "Then Jeremiah said, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.\n",
      "The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.\n",
      "When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;\n",
      "Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Yahweh? Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.\n",
      "Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?\n",
      "Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?\n",
      "Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.\n",
      "Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.\n",
      "Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh says, He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey, and he shall live.\n",
      "Yahweh says, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.\n",
      "Then the princes said to the king, “Please let this man be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of this people, but the hurt.”\n",
      "Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he who can do anything against you.\n",
      "Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.\n",
      "Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),\n",
      "Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying,\n",
      "My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.\n",
      "Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.\n",
      "So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.\n",
      "Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords. Jeremiah did so.\n",
      "So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.\n",
      "Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in Yahweh’s house: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.\n",
      "Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.\n",
      "So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.\n",
      "Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: If you will go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and your house.\n",
      "But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.\n",
      "Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.\n",
      "But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. Obey, I beg you, the voice of Yahweh, in that which I speak to you: so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live.\n",
      "But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me:\n",
      "behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought out to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say, Your familiar friends have set you on, and have prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mire, they have turned away back.\n",
      "They shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.\n",
      "Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.\n",
      "But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you:\n",
      "then you shall tell them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.\n",
      "Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.\n",
      "So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.\n",
      "When Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;\n",
      "in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city),\n",
      "all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.\n",
      "When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.\n",
      "But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment on him.\n",
      "Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah.\n",
      "Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.\n",
      "The Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.\n",
      "Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the residue of the people who remained.\n",
      "But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.\n",
      "Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying,\n",
      "Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall tell you.\n",
      "So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;\n",
      "they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he lived among the people.\n",
      "Now Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,\n",
      "Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before you in that day.\n",
      "But I will deliver you in that day, says Yahweh; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.\n",
      "For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be for a prey to you; because you have put your trust in me, says Yahweh.\n",
      "The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon.\n",
      "The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;\n",
      "and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke: because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come on you.\n",
      "Now, behold, I release you this day from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don’t: behold, all the land is before you; where it seems good and right to you to go, there go.\n",
      "Now while he had not yet gone back, Go back then, he said, to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go.\n",
      "Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.\n",
      "Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon;\n",
      "then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.\n",
      "Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.\n",
      "As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us: but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.\n",
      "Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;\n",
      "then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.\n",
      "Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,\n",
      "and said to him, Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them.\n",
      "Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?\n",
      "But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael.\n",
      "Now in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.\n",
      "Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.\n",
      "Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.\n",
      "The second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it,\n",
      "men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to Yahweh’s house.\n",
      "Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”\n",
      "It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him.\n",
      "But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, Don’t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he stopped, and didn’t kill them among their brothers.\n",
      "Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was who which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed.\n",
      "Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people who were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.\n",
      "But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,\n",
      "then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.\n",
      "Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad.\n",
      "So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.\n",
      "But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.\n",
      "Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon:\n",
      "and they departed, and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,\n",
      "because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.\n",
      "Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near,\n",
      "and said to Jeremiah the prophet, Please let our supplication be presented before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes do see us:\n",
      "that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do.\n",
      "Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words; and it shall happen that whatever thing Yahweh shall answer you, I will declare it to you; I will keep nothing back from you.\n",
      "Then they said to Jeremiah, Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us, if we don’t do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God shall send you to us.\n",
      "Whether it is good, or whether it is bad, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.\n",
      "After ten days, Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah.\n",
      "Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,\n",
      "and said to them, Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him, says:\n",
      "If you will still live in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you.\n",
      "Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; don’t be afraid of him, says Yahweh: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.\n",
      "I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land.\n",
      "But if you say, We will not dwell in this land; so that you don’t obey Yahweh your God’s voice,\n",
      "saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:\n",
      "now therefore hear Yahweh’s word, O remnant of Judah: Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to live there;\n",
      "then it shall happen, that the sword, which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, shall follow close behind you there in Egypt; and there you shall die.\n",
      "So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.\n",
      "For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: As my anger and my wrath has been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured out on you, when you shall enter into Egypt; and you shall be an object of horror, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.\n",
      "Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, Don’t you go into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified to you this day.\n",
      "For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, Pray for us to Yahweh our God; and according to all that Yahweh our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do it:\n",
      "and I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyed Yahweh your God’s voice in anything for which he has sent me to you.\n",
      "Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where you desire to go to live there.\n",
      "When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them, even all these words,\n",
      "then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, You speak falsely: Yahweh our God has not sent you to say, You shall not go into Egypt to live there;\n",
      "but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.\n",
      "So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn’t obey the voice of Yahweh, to dwell in the land of Judah.\n",
      "But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah;\n",
      "the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;\n",
      "and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn’t obey the voice of Yahweh: and they came to Tahpanhes.\n",
      "Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,\n",
      "Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;\n",
      "and tell them, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.\n",
      "He shall come, and shall strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death shall be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.\n",
      "I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go out from there in peace.\n",
      "He shall also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.\n",
      "The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: You have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwells therein,\n",
      "because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods, that they didn’t know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.\n",
      "However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, don’t do this abominable thing that I hate.\n",
      "But they didn’t listen, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods.\n",
      "Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.\n",
      "Therefore now Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Why do you commit great evil against your own souls, to cut off from yourselves man and woman, infant and nursing child out of the middle of Judah, to leave yourselves no one remaining;\n",
      "in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to live; that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?\n",
      "Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?\n",
      "They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.\n",
      "Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.\n",
      "I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an object of horror, an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.\n",
      "For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;\n",
      "so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, shall escape or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for no one shall return save such as shall escape.\n",
      "Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,\n",
      "As for the word that you have spoken to us in Yahweh’s name, we will not listen to you.\n",
      "But we will certainly perform every word that has gone out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil.\n",
      "But since we left off burning incense to the queen of the sky, and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.\n",
      "When we burned incense to the queen of the sky, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?\n",
      "Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people who had given him an answer, saying,\n",
      "The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, didn’t Yahweh remember them, and didn’t it come into his mind?\n",
      "so that Yahweh could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed; therefore your land has become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.\n",
      "Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is this day.\n",
      "Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear Yahweh’s word, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt:\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her: establish then your vows, and perform your vows.\n",
      "Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says Yahweh, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Yahweh lives.\n",
      "Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until they are all gone.\n",
      "Those who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.\n",
      "This shall be the sign to you, says Yahweh, that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:\n",
      "Yahweh says, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life.\n",
      "The message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,\n",
      "Yahweh, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:\n",
      "You said, Woe is me now! for Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.\n",
      "You shall tell him, Yahweh says: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.\n",
      "Do you seek great things for yourself? Don’t seek them; for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, says Yahweh; but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go.\n",
      "Yahweh’s word which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.\n",
      "Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.\n",
      "Prepare the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle!\n",
      "Harness the horses, and get up, you horsemen, and stand up with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail.\n",
      "Why have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward; and their mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled apace, and don’t look back: terror is on every side, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Don’t let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen.\n",
      "Who is this who rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?\n",
      "Egypt rises up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers: and he says, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities and its inhabitants.\n",
      "Go up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men go out: Cush and Put, who handle the shield; and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.\n",
      "For that day is of the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood; for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.\n",
      "Go up into Gilead, and take balm, virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain do you use many medicines; there is no healing for you.\n",
      "The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together.\n",
      "The word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt.\n",
      "Declare in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say, Stand up, and prepare; for the sword has devoured around you.\n",
      "Why are your strong ones swept away? they didn’t stand, because Yahweh pushed them.\n",
      "He made many to stumble, yes, they fell one on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword.\n",
      "They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has let the appointed time pass by.\n",
      "As I live, says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.\n",
      "You daughter who dwells in Egypt, furnish yourself to go into captivity; for Memphis shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant.\n",
      "Egypt is a very beautiful heifer; but destruction out of the north has come, it has come.\n",

      "Yahweh has opened his armory, and has brought out the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.\n",
      "Come against her from the utmost border; open her storehouses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.\n",

      "The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God, the vengeance of his temple.\n",
      "Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow; encamp against her all around; let none of it escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her; for she has been proud against Yahweh, against the Holy One of Israel.\n",
      "Therefore her young men will fall in her streets, and all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh.\n",
      "Behold, I am against you, you proud one, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies; for your day has come, the time that I will visit you.\n",
      "The proud one shall stumble and fall, and no one shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all who are around him.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies says: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all who took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.\n",
      "Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Armies is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.\n",
      "A sword is on the Chaldeans, says Yahweh, and on the inhabitants of Babylon, and on her princes, and on her wise men.\n",
      "A sword is on the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is on her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.\n",
      "A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots, and on all the mixed people who are in the middle of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is on her treasures, and they shall be robbed.\n",
      "A drought is on her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of engraved images, and they are mad over idols.\n",
      "Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation.\n",
      "As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man live therein.\n",
      "Behold, a people comes from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.\n",
      "They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Babylon.\n",
      "The king of Babylon has heard the news of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of him, pains as of a woman in labor.\n",
      "Behold, the enemy shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who can stand before me?\n",
      "Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.\n",
      "At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles, and the cry is heard among the nations.\n",
      "Yahweh says: Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against those who dwell in Lebkamai, a destroying wind.\n",
      "I will send to Babylon strangers, who shall winnow her; and they shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around.\n",
      "Against him who bends let the archer bend his bow, and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail: and don’t spare her young men; utterly destroy all her army.\n",
      "They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her streets.\n",
      "For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Yahweh of Armies; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.\n",
      "Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and save every man his life; don’t be cut off in her iniquity: for it is the time of Yahweh’s vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.\n",
      "Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh’s hand, who made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.\n",
      "Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.\n",
      "We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go everyone into his own country; for her judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.\n",
      "Yahweh has produced our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Yahweh our God.\n",
      "Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields: Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it: for it is the vengeance of Yahweh, the vengeance of his temple.\n",
      "Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for Yahweh has both purposed and done that which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.\n",
      "You who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your covetousness.\n",
      "Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men, as with the canker worm; and they shall lift up a shout against you.\n"
